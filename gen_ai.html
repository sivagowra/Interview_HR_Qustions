        <h1>LLMs Capabilities in Generative AI</h1>
        <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful AI models that can perform many tasks in Generative AI. They can generate content, understand language, and help create applications. Below is a description of their main capabilities in simple English.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Text Generation</h2>
        <p>LLMs can generate text automatically in many forms. They can write essays, articles, stories, emails, social media posts, and even code. They are capable of answering questions intelligently and providing creative writing suggestions. They can
            summarize long text into key points, draft reports and documentation, and suggest dialogue for chatbots or virtual assistants. Essentially, LLMs can create almost any type of text content you need, quickly and accurately.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Image Generation</h2>
        <p>LLMs, when combined with generative image models, can create images from text prompts. They can produce illustrations, digital art, logos, and branding visuals. They can turn sketches into polished images, generate avatars or character designs,
            and create realistic photos for media or advertisements. They can also produce graphics for social media posts, concept art for games or movies, patterns and textures for designs, and even storyboards or visual ideas from text descriptions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Summarization</h2>
        <p>LLMs can read and understand long documents and then provide concise summaries. They can shorten articles into key points, create executive summaries of reports, or provide bullet-point summaries for books or papers. They can give quick overviews
            of news articles, summarize meeting notes, highlight the main points of research papers, and create concise versions of emails. They can also extract important data from documents, make summaries easy to understand, and provide TL;DR versions
            for quick reading.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Classification </h2>
        <p>LLMs can classify information into categories. For example, they can sort text as spam or not spam, detect sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, and tag topics in articles. They can identify the language of a text, understand customer intent,
            and classify messages on social media or emails. They can also label images or other content automatically, categorize products in e-commerce data, detect harmful content, and organize documents for easy search and retrieval.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Translation</h2>
        <p>LLMs can translate text between multiple languages. They can provide multilingual customer support, translate websites and apps for global audiences, and convert documents into other languages. They can support subtitles for videos, translate
            technical content accurately, help learners understand foreign languages, enable real-time chat translation, translate user reviews or comments, and assist in localization for international marketing. This makes LLMs very useful for connecting
            people across languages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
    <h1>Types of Prompting</h1>
    <p>Definition of Prompting<br>
        Prompting is the process of giving specific instructions, questions, or examples to an AI model (like ChatGPT) to guide its response or behavior.<br>
        A prompt is the input text or command you give ‚Äî and prompting is how you design and structure that input to get the desired output.</p>
        <h2>üß† 1. Zero-Shot Prompting</h2>
        <p>Zero-shot prompting means giving the model a question or task without any examples or prior instructions. The model uses its existing knowledge to produce an answer. This method is useful when you want a quick response without training or guiding
            the model. It depends fully on the model‚Äôs understanding of the language and context. It works best for straightforward questions like definitions, summaries, or factual answers. However, accuracy may decrease if the task is complex or unfamiliar.
            The advantage is simplicity and speed ‚Äî you just ‚Äúask and get.‚Äù It‚Äôs widely used in Q&A systems and chatbots.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>‚ÄúTranslate ‚ÄòGood morning‚Äô to French.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúWhat is the capital of Japan?‚Äù</p>  
        <p>‚ÄúWrite a short paragraph about global warming.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>üß© 2. Few-Shot Prompting</h2>
        <p>Few-shot prompting involves providing a few examples before asking the model to complete a similar task. These examples teach the model the format, style, or logic of what you want. It helps improve accuracy and control, especially for specific
            or structured outputs. The model learns from context instead of fine-tuning. This technique is powerful for text classification, data extraction, or summarization patterns. The more relevant your examples are, the better the result. It balances
            flexibility and performance well.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>‚ÄúClassify the sentiment: ‚ÄòI love this movie!‚Äô ‚Üí Positive. ‚ÄòThis is boring.‚Äô ‚Üí Negative. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs okay.‚Äô ‚Üí Neutral. Now classify: ‚ÄòI hate rain.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúTranslate: Hello ‚Üí Hola, Cat ‚Üí Gato, Dog ‚Üí Perro. Now translate: Apple ‚Üí ?‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúSummarize these reviews in one line: [give 2‚Äì3 examples], then summarize a new one.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>üîó 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h2>
        <p>Chain-of-thought prompting means asking the model to explain its reasoning step by step before giving the final answer. It helps the model think logically and solve complex problems like math, reasoning, or code debugging. This technique mimics
            human thinking ‚Äî ‚Äúthinking aloud.‚Äù It‚Äôs useful when accuracy and reasoning transparency are important. It encourages better intermediate steps instead of jumping to a conclusion. Often used in AI reasoning tasks and research.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>‚ÄúQ: If John has 5 apples and buys 3 more, how many does he have? Let‚Äôs think step by step.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúExplain how photosynthesis works step by step.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúSolve 25 √ó 12 = ? Show your steps clearly.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>üßæ 4. Instruction-Based Prompting</h2>
        <p>Instruction-based prompting gives the model a clear directive or command about what to do, how to do it, and what style or tone to use. It‚Äôs the most common way modern models (like GPT) work ‚Äî following explicit instructions in natural language.
            It can specify format, purpose, or voice. The clearer the instruction, the better the response. It‚Äôs highly flexible for content creation, explanations, or summaries.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>‚ÄúWrite a formal email to request a leave of absence.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúExplain machine learning in simple words for a 10-year-old.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúSummarize this paragraph in exactly 3 bullet points.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>üé≠ 5. Role-Based Prompting</h2>
        <p>Role-based prompting assigns a specific role or persona to the model before asking a task. This helps generate more context-aware and stylistic responses. By defining the model‚Äôs role, you control tone, perspective, and domain knowledge. It‚Äôs
            useful for simulations, interviews, or expert-style responses. It enhances creativity and focus by aligning behavior with the assigned role.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>‚ÄúAct as a professional UI developer and explain how Tailwind CSS works.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúYou are a history teacher. Explain the French Revolution.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúPretend to be a customer support agent and respond to this complaint politely.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>üí¨ 6. Interactive Prompting</h2>
        <p>Interactive prompting involves back-and-forth conversation between the user and the model to refine or improve responses. It‚Äôs not a one-time prompt ‚Äî it‚Äôs a dialogue where each turn improves the context. This is useful for brainstorming, coding
            help, or learning new topics. The interaction builds shared understanding over time. It also helps when you‚Äôre unsure what exactly you want and need to explore.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>User: ‚ÄúWrite a poem.‚Äù ‚Üí Model: [gives poem]. User: ‚ÄúMake it funnier and shorter.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúGenerate 3 quiz questions.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúNow make them harder.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúExplain blockchain.‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúNow simplify it for school students.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>‚öñÔ∏è 7. Comparison Prompting</h2>
        <p>Comparison prompting asks the model to compare two or more items, ideas, or responses. It‚Äôs useful for decision-making, evaluation, or analysis. You can compare based on features, pros and cons, or performance. It improves understanding of relationships
            and differences. It also helps generate balanced, analytical, or critical responses. Ideal for reviews, product comparisons, or debates.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>‚ÄúCompare Python and JavaScript in web development.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúWhat are the differences between AWS EC2 and AWS Lambda?‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúCompare ChatGPT and Google Gemini ‚Äî which is better for summarization?‚Äù</p>

        <h2>üîÑ 8. Conditional Prompting</h2>
        <p>Conditional prompting means giving the model rules or conditions that decide how it should respond. The model adapts based on those conditions, similar to ‚Äúif-else‚Äù logic in programming. It helps control outputs for multiple scenarios in one prompt.
            It‚Äôs great for structured workflows, automated scripts, or chatbots that respond differently based on user input.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>‚ÄúIf the input is positive, reply ‚ÄòGreat!‚Äô; if negative, reply ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry to hear that.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúIf the question is about Python, give a code example; otherwise, just explain.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúIf the sentence includes a number, convert it to words.‚Äù</p>

        <h2>üí° 9. Creative Brainstorming Prompting</h2>
        <p>Creative brainstorming prompting is used to generate multiple unique ideas or explore creative directions. Instead of asking for one answer, you encourage variety, imagination, and novelty. It‚Äôs helpful in idea generation, storytelling, marketing,
            and design. It allows the model to think freely and combine unexpected concepts. This kind of prompting promotes innovation and experimentation.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <p>‚ÄúGive 5 unique startup ideas using AI in education.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúSuggest creative names for a coffee shop with a travel theme.‚Äù</p>
        <p>‚ÄúBrainstorm ways to use drones for agriculture improvement.‚Äù</p>

            <p>LLM vectors, also called <strong>embeddings</strong>, are groups of numbers that represent the meaning of words, sentences, or documents.</p>
            <p>They help a computer understand text not just by letters but by <strong>meaning and similarity</strong>.</p>
            <p>Each piece of text is converted into a list of hundreds or thousands of numbers.</p>
            <p>Texts with similar meanings get vectors that are <strong>close together</strong> in value.</p>

            <h2>What are Embeddings?</h2>
            <p>Embeddings are <strong>lists of numbers (vectors)</strong> that represent the meaning of text. Each word, sentence, or entire document is converted into a numeric list (for example, 1,536 numbers). When two texts have similar meaning, their
                vectors are <strong>close together</strong>; when meanings differ, the vectors are <strong>far apart</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Why use Embeddings? (Main Use Cases)</h2>
            <p>OpenAI embeddings are used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Search</strong> ‚Äî find relevant documents by meaning, not just keywords.</li>
                <li><strong>Clustering</strong> ‚Äî group similar texts automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendations</strong> ‚Äî suggest items with similar descriptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Anomaly detection</strong> ‚Äî find outliers that are very different.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversity measurement</strong> ‚Äî check how varied a set of texts is.</li>
                <li><strong>Classification</strong> ‚Äî assign a text to a class by similarity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to get an Embedding (Code)</h2>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>from openai import OpenAI

)

print(response.data[0].embedding)</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The result is a JSON object containing the embedding vector (a list of floating-point numbers) and usage metadata. Each number helps describe the text's meaning.</p>

            <h2>FAQ (Important Questions)</h2>
            <p><strong>Q1: How to count tokens before embedding?</strong>
                <br> Use the <code>tiktoken</code> library to count tokens for the model's encoding (e.g., <code>cl100k_base</code> for v3 models):</p>
            <div class="code"><pre>import tiktoken
encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
num_tokens = len(encoding.encode("Hello world"))</pre></div>

            <p><strong>Q2: How to search many vectors quickly?</strong>
                <br> Use a vector database like FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, or Milvus for fast nearest-neighbor search.</p>

            <p><strong>Q3: Which distance function should I use?</strong>
                <br> Cosine similarity is recommended. OpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, so cosine similarity can be computed with a dot product and gives the same ranking as Euclidean distance on normalized vectors.</p>

            <p><strong>Q4: Can I share my embeddings?</strong>
                <br> Yes ‚Äî customers own inputs and outputs. Make sure your data sharing follows applicable laws and OpenAI Terms.</p>

            <p><strong>Q5: Do embeddings know recent events?</strong>
                <br> No ‚Äî text-embedding-3 models were trained on data up to September 2021. They do not know events after that date.</p>

            <h2>Short Summary (One Paragraph)</h2>
            <p>Embeddings are numeric vectors that capture text meaning. They allow machines to measure how similar or different texts are. Use them for search, recommendations, classification, clustering, and many other tasks. OpenAI provides v3 models
                that are powerful, multilingual, and cost-effective for embedding-based applications.</p>

  <h2>Vector databases and LLMs</h2>
  <p>
    Vector databases are essential for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by providing them with persistent memory,
    overcoming training data cutoffs, and enabling the integration of proprietary data through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
  </p>

  <p>
    They store data as <strong>vector embeddings</strong>, which are numerical representations that preserve semantic meaning,
    allowing for efficient similarity searches and context-aware responses.
    This integration is critical for building production-ready generative AI applications that require real-time data retrieval
    and accurate, up-to-date information.
  </p>

  <h3>How they help</h3>
  <p>
    Vector databases enable <em>semantic similarity search</em>, allowing LLMs to find contextually relevant information
    even when exact keywords are absent.
  </p>

  <h3>Typical integration process</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Convert unstructured data into embeddings.</li>
    <li>Store the embeddings in the vector database.</li>
    <li>Use search techniques like Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) to retrieve similar vectors.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    A common implementation method is RAG, where a user query is converted into a vector, searched against the database,
    and the retrieved context is used to augment the LLM's response generation.
  </p>

  <h3>Features & examples</h3>
  <p>
    Modern vector databases like <em>Weaviate</em>, <em>Pinecone</em>, and <em>Milvus</em> support hybrid search,
    combining keyword-based (e.g., BM25) and vector-based search to improve result accuracy.
    Developers can integrate vector databases with LLMs using frameworks that allow for seamless retrieval-augmented generation,
    such as Weaviate‚Äôs <code>.with_generate()</code> method, which extends a semantic search query to include a summarization prompt.
  </p>

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensuring data quality.</li>
    <li>Avoiding biases in training data.</li>
    <li>Managing engineering complexity, especially when scaling to billions of data objects.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2>

  <p>
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI method that improves large language models (LLMs)
    by connecting them with outside and up-to-date data sources. This helps the models give more
    accurate, current, and topic-specific answers without needing new training.
  </p>

  <p>
    The RAG process has two main steps. First, a retrieval model searches a vector database to find
    documents or information that are similar in meaning to the user‚Äôs question. Second, this found
    information is added to the user‚Äôs prompt and sent to the language model, which creates a final
    answer using both the external data and its built-in knowledge.
  </p>

  <p>
    This method reduces the chance of AI making up wrong information (called hallucinations) by
    using real and trusted data. It also helps models show where the information came from, which
    makes the results clearer and builds user trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    RAG is especially useful for business and research tools, such as smart chatbots and knowledge
    systems. It lets companies safely connect their models to private or live data sources while
    keeping control over who can access the data and lowering the cost of computation.
