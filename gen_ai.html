                <h2>Large Language Model (LLM)</h2>
                <p>A Large Language Model (LLM) is a smart computer program that can understand and write human language.
                    It learns by reading a huge amount of text from books, websites, and articles. After learning, it can do
                    many things like answering questions, writing essays, translating languages, summarizing text, or even helping 
                    with computer code. LLMs use a special method called deep learning, which helps them find patterns in words and sentences. 
                    Famous examples are ChatGPT by OpenAI, Gemini by Google, and LLaMA by Meta. These models have billions of small parts called parameters 
                    that help them make better guesses about what to say next. They are used in chatbots, search tools, and AI assistants. Before being used, 
                    they go through training and fine-tuning to make them more useful and accurate. Although LLMs are very powerful, they can sometimes make mistakes 
                    or give wrong information. Still, they are changing the way people talk and work with computers.</p>

    <h2>Vector DB</h2>
    <p>
        A vector database is a special kind of database made to store and search data represented as vectors, which are numerical lists showing meanings or features of information.
        These vectors come from AI models that convert text, images, or audio into numbers so computers can understand them. Vector databases help find similar items quickly by comparing
        how close these vectors are to each other. For example, they can be used to search for text with similar meaning or images that look alike. Unlike normal databases that match exact values, 
        vector databases find results based on meaning or similarity. They are very useful in AI applications like chatbots, recommendation systems, and image recognition. Popular vector databases 
        include Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate, and Milvus. In simple terms, a vector database helps AI find and understand things that are alike in meaning, not just in words.

    <h2>LangGraph</h2>
    <p>
        LangGraph is an open-source framework that helps you build powerful AI agents which can do more than just
        answer a single question. It uses a graph-style architecture where each node is a particular action or decision,
        and the connections between them define how the workflow can branch, loop, or change direction depending on what’s
        happening. Because it stores long-term context and memory, an agent built with LangGraph can remember earlier 
        interactions or states across a session — this makes it good for complex tasks that require many steps. 
        You can also include a human in the loop, so people can intervene, monitor, or correct the agent when needed, 
        which increases reliability in real-world use. Unlike simpler frameworks, LangGraph is made for production-scale
        agent orchestration — it gives developers more control and flexibility than something like a simple chain model. 
        It works well alongside LangChain too, but LangGraph is focused on complex, multi-step workflows. Best of all, 
        it's completely free and open-source under the MIT license, so you can freely use and customize it </p>

    <h2>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2>

  <p>
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI method that improves large language models (LLMs)
    by connecting them with outside and up-to-date data sources. This helps the models give more
    accurate, current, and topic-specific answers without needing new training.
  </p>

  <p>
    The RAG process has two main steps. First, a retrieval model searches a vector database to find
    documents or information that are similar in meaning to the user’s question. Second, this found
    information is added to the user’s prompt and sent to the language model, which creates a final
    answer using both the external data and its built-in knowledge.
  </p>

  <p>
    This method reduces the chance of AI making up wrong information (called hallucinations) by
    using real and trusted data. It also helps models show where the information came from, which
    makes the results clearer and builds user trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    RAG is especially useful for business and research tools, such as smart chatbots and knowledge
    systems. It lets companies safely connect their models to private or live data sources while
    keeping control over who can access the data and lowering the cost of computation.

            <h2>What are Embeddings?</h2>
            <p>Embeddings are <strong>lists of numbers (vectors)</strong> that represent the meaning of text. Each word, sentence, or entire document is converted into a numeric list (for example, 1,536 numbers). When two texts have similar meaning, their
                vectors are <strong>close together</strong>; when meanings differ, the vectors are <strong>far apart</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Why use Embeddings? (Main Use Cases)</h2>
            <p>OpenAI embeddings are used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Search</strong> — find relevant documents by meaning, not just keywords.</li>
                <li><strong>Clustering</strong> — group similar texts automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendations</strong> — suggest items with similar descriptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Anomaly detection</strong> — find outliers that are very different.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversity measurement</strong> — check how varied a set of texts is.</li>
                <li><strong>Classification</strong> — assign a text to a class by similarity.</li>
            </ul>

  <h2>Vector databases and LLMs</h2>
  <p>
    Vector databases are essential for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by providing them with persistent memory,
    overcoming training data cutoffs, and enabling the integration of proprietary data through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
  </p>

  <p>
    They store data as <strong>vector embeddings</strong>, which are numerical representations that preserve semantic meaning,
    allowing for efficient similarity searches and context-aware responses.
    This integration is critical for building production-ready generative AI applications that require real-time data retrieval
    and accurate, up-to-date information.
  </p>

  <h3>How they help</h3>
  <p>
    Vector databases enable <em>semantic similarity search</em>, allowing LLMs to find contextually relevant information
    even when exact keywords are absent.
  </p>

  <h3>Typical integration process</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Convert unstructured data into embeddings.</li>
    <li>Store the embeddings in the vector database.</li>
    <li>Use search techniques like Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) to retrieve similar vectors.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    A common implementation method is RAG, where a user query is converted into a vector, searched against the database,
    and the retrieved context is used to augment the LLM's response generation.
  </p>

  <h3>Features & examples</h3>
  <p>
    Modern vector databases like <em>Weaviate</em>, <em>Pinecone</em>, and <em>Milvus</em> support hybrid search,
    combining keyword-based (e.g., BM25) and vector-based search to improve result accuracy.
    Developers can integrate vector databases with LLMs using frameworks that allow for seamless retrieval-augmented generation,
    such as Weaviate’s <code>.with_generate()</code> method, which extends a semantic search query to include a summarization prompt.
  </p>

  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensuring data quality.</li>
    <li>Avoiding biases in training data.</li>
    <li>Managing engineering complexity, especially when scaling to billions of data objects.</li>
  </ul>
