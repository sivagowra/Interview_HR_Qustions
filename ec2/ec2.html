  <h2>Spot Instances</h2>
  <p>Spot Instances use unused AWS EC2 capacity that is available at that time.</p>
  <p>They are very low cost compared to other EC2 purchasing options.</p>
  <p>AWS can stop or terminate Spot Instances at any time if capacity is needed.</p>
  <p>They are mainly used for fault-tolerant and flexible workloads.</p>
  <p>Spot Instances are good for batch jobs, data processing, and testing.</p>
  <p>They are not suitable for critical or production applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <h2>On-Demand Instances</h2>
  <p>On-Demand Instances do not require any long-term commitment.</p>
  <p>You pay only for the compute time you actually use.</p>
  <p>There is no upfront payment required to start an instance.</p>
  <p>This option provides high flexibility to start or stop anytime.</p>
  <p>On-Demand is commonly used for testing and short-term workloads.</p>
  <p>It is the most expensive EC2 pricing option.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <h2>Savings Plans</h2>
  <p>Savings Plans require a commitment for one or three years.</p>
  <p>They apply to EC2, Lambda, and Fargate services.</p>
  <p>Savings Plans are more flexible compared to Reserved Instances.</p>
  <p>You commit to a fixed hourly usage instead of instance type.</p>
  <p>This helps reduce overall AWS compute cost.</p>
  <p>They are best for steady and predictable workloads.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <h2>Reserved Instances</h2>
  <p>Reserved Instances require a long-term commitment of one or three years.</p>
  <p>They provide significant cost savings compared to On-Demand pricing.</p>
  <p>You must choose a specific instance type and region.</p>
  <p>Reserved Instances are commonly used for production workloads.</p>
  <p>They are suitable for applications running 24/7.</p>
  <p>This option offers less flexibility than Savings Plans.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <h2>Dedicated Hosts</h2>
  <p>Dedicated Hosts provide a full physical server for one AWS account.</p>
  <p>No other AWS customers share the hardware.</p>
  <p>They support Bring Your Own License (BYOL).</p>
  <p>You get full control over CPU, memory, and placement.</p>
  <p>Dedicated Hosts are used for compliance and licensing needs.</p>
  <p>This is the most expensive EC2 option.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <h2>Dedicated Instances</h2>
  <p>Dedicated Instances run on hardware dedicated to one AWS account.</p>
  <p>They are not shared with other AWS customers.</p>
  <p>You do not get full hardware control like Dedicated Hosts.</p>
  <p>They are mainly used when isolation is required.</p>
  <p>Dedicated Instances cost more than On-Demand Instances.</p>
  <p>They are cheaper than Dedicated Hosts.</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <h2>Capacity Reservations</h2>
  <p>Capacity Reservations guarantee EC2 capacity in a specific Availability Zone.</p>
  <p>They ensure instances are always available when needed.</p>
  <p>No long-term commitment is required.</p>
  <p>This option is used for critical and business applications.</p>
  <p>You are charged at standard On-Demand pricing.</p>
  <p>Capacity Reservations help avoid capacity shortages.</p>
