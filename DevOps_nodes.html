    <h1>What is Cloud?</h1>
    <p class="lead"><strong>Cloud (or Cloud Computing)</strong> is the delivery of computing services ‚Äî such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics ‚Äî over the internet instead of using a local computer or physical server. In simple terms: using other companies' computers on the internet to store data or run programs.</p>

    <p>Cloud computing allows individuals and organizations to access computing resources on demand without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware. It helps businesses scale resources up or down according to their needs, providing flexibility and cost savings.</p>
    <p>For example, instead of building a data center, a startup can rent cloud servers and databases from AWS or Google Cloud. This helps them go to market faster while only paying for what they use.</p>

     <h2>üßë‚Äçüíª DevOps</h2>
    <p>
      DevOps is a modern software engineering approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams 
      to work collaboratively throughout the entire software lifecycle. It focuses on automation, continuous integration, 
      continuous deployment (CI/CD), and monitoring to deliver high-quality applications faster. 
      DevOps encourages a culture of communication and feedback between teams, helping organizations respond quickly 
      to market changes. By using tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, it streamlines workflows and reduces 
      human errors in deployment. The main goal of DevOps is to achieve faster delivery, better reliability, 
      and consistent improvement in software performance.

    <h2>‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud Computing is a technology that delivers computing services‚Äîsuch as servers, storage, databases, networking, 
      and software‚Äîover the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. It eliminates the need for organizations to own and maintain 
      physical infrastructure, providing flexibility and cost savings. Cloud services are typically categorized into 
      Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
      Leading providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer scalable and secure environments 
      for hosting and deploying applications globally. The primary aim of cloud computing is to provide 
      easy access to IT resources, scalability, and business continuity.

  </div>

  <section class="card" id="local-zones">
    <h2>üèôÔ∏è 1. AWS Local Zones</h2>
    <p>Local Zones are mini AWS data centers located close to big cities. They help run applications that need very low delay (latency), such as online gaming, video streaming, and real-time apps.</p>
    <p><strong>More details:</strong> Instead of sending data to faraway AWS Regions, Local Zones bring compute and storage closer to end users. This reduces response time and improves user experience for latency-sensitive workloads.</p>
    <p>Example: If users are in Mumbai, an AWS Local Zone in Mumbai helps data travel faster to them. It is ideal for healthcare, media, and gaming applications.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="outposts">
    <h2>üè¢ 2. AWS Outposts</h2>
    <p>AWS Outposts bring AWS servers and tools into your own data center. It‚Äôs like having a small AWS cloud inside your office.</p>
    <p><strong>More details:</strong> Outposts let companies run AWS services on-premises while maintaining a connection to the main AWS cloud. It‚Äôs useful for industries like banking, healthcare, or government where data compliance or local processing is required.</p>
    <p>Outposts come in two types: fully managed racks by AWS, or small form-factor servers for smaller sites. It provides consistent APIs and services as in AWS Cloud.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="wavelength">
    <h2>üì± 3. AWS Wavelength Zones</h2>
    <p>Wavelength Zones are built inside telecom networks (4G/5G). AWS places servers in telecom operator sites so mobile apps get ultra-low latency.</p>
    <p><strong>More details:</strong> This helps developers build edge applications such as live streaming, AR/VR, and autonomous vehicles that need milliseconds of response time. AWS partners with telecoms like Verizon, Vodafone, and Bharti Airtel to provide these zones.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="snowball">
    <h2>üßä 4. AWS Snowball (Data Transfer)</h2>
    <p>AWS Snowball is a physical data transfer device used to move large amounts of data (terabytes or petabytes) to AWS without using the public internet.</p>
    <p><strong>More details:</strong> It helps organizations migrate or back up huge datasets securely. Snowball devices come encrypted, tamper-resistant, and are ideal for areas with poor internet connectivity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Snowball Edge Storage Optimized:</strong> Larger storage and some local compute.</li>

    <h2>üåç Types of Cloud: Public, Private, Hybrid</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
      <p>A Public Cloud is a type of cloud that is owned and managed by companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. It is open for anyone to use through the internet. Many people and organizations share the same servers and storage, but their data stays separate. It is easy to start using and you only pay for what you use. Public clouds are cheaper and very good for small companies or startups. They are mostly used for hosting websites, apps, and online services.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
      <p> A Private Cloud is made for one single company or organization. It can be hosted inside the company‚Äôs office or by a trusted cloud provider. This cloud is not shared with others, so it gives more privacy and control. It is very secure and is often used for storing sensitive data. Big companies, banks, and government offices use private clouds to protect important information. It costs more than public cloud but gives full control over data and security.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
      <p>A Hybrid Cloud is a mix of public and private clouds working together. It allows data and applications to move between both types of clouds easily. This helps companies use the public cloud for simple tasks and the private cloud for secure work. It provides flexibility, better cost control, and improved performance. Many organizations use hybrid clouds to balance safety and scalability. For example, AWS Outposts or Azure Arc are used for hybrid cloud systems.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">4. Public IP</h2>
          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-300">A Public IP is an internet-facing address that lets your EC2 instance communicate with the outside world. It allows people to visit your website or connect to your server remotely. You can use it to host web applications, APIs, or connect through SSH and RDP. However, AWS-assigned public IPs are temporary and may change when you restart the instance. To keep a fixed address, you should use an Elastic IP. Public IPs are essential when your instance needs to be accessed from anywhere</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">5. Private IP</h2>
          <p class="mt-3 text-slate-300">
A Private IP is used for internal communication inside your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It allows EC2 instances to talk securely without using the public internet. This is ideal for backend servers, databases, and internal applications. Private IPs protect your systems by keeping them invisible to the outside world. Every EC2 instance automatically gets one private IP when it starts. It‚Äôs like having an internal phone number used only inside your company‚Äôs network.</p>
