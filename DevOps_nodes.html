         <h2>☁️ Cloud Computing</h2>
         <p>
            Cloud Computing is a technology that delivers computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, 
            and software—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. It eliminates the need for organizations to own and maintain 
            physical infrastructure, providing flexibility and cost savings. Cloud services are typically categorized into 
            Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). 
            Leading providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud offer scalable and secure environments 
            for hosting and deploying applications globally. The primary aim of cloud computing is to provide 
            easy access to IT resources, scalability, and business continuity.

         <h2>🧑‍💻 DevOps</h2>
         <p>
            DevOps is a modern software engineering approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams 
            to work collaboratively throughout the entire software lifecycle. It focuses on automation, continuous integration, 
            continuous deployment (CI/CD), and monitoring to deliver high-quality applications faster. 
            DevOps encourages a culture of communication and feedback between teams, helping organizations respond quickly 
            to market changes. By using tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, it streamlines workflows and reduces 
            human errors in deployment. The main goal of DevOps is to achieve faster delivery, better reliability, 
            and consistent improvement in software performance.

            <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
            <li>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</li>

      </div>
      <section class="card" id="regions">
         <h2>🌍 1. AWS Regions</h2>
         <p>
            AWS Regions are large geographical areas where Amazon has built data centers. Each region is separate to provide better security and reliability. 
            Regions help users choose where they want to store data and run applications. For example, there are AWS Regions in Mumbai, London, and Tokyo.
            If your business is in India, using the Mumbai Region gives faster performance. Regions also help follow local data laws.
         </p>
         <h2>🏗️ 2. AWS Availability Zones (AZs)</h2>
         <p>
            Each AWS Region has multiple Availability Zones. An Availability Zone is a group of one or more data centers inside a region.
            They are built close together but separately, so if one fails, others keep running. This setup improves high availability and disaster recovery.
            For example, the Mumbai Region has 3 AZs. If one AZ goes down, your app still runs using another AZ. It helps businesses stay online always.
         </p>
         <h2>🏙️ 3. AWS Local Zones</h2>
         <p>
            Local Zones are smaller AWS data centers placed near big cities. They help reduce delay (latency) for apps that need fast response.
            Data does not travel far to main regions, so apps like gaming, video streaming, and healthcare run faster. 
            For example, AWS has a Local Zone in Mumbai to serve local users quickly. It’s great for real-time and media-based apps.
            Local Zones bring cloud power closer to end users for a smoother experience.
         </p>
         <h2>🏢 4. AWS Outposts</h2>
         <p>
            AWS Outposts bring AWS servers and tools directly into your own building or data center. It’s like having a small AWS inside your office.
            It helps companies that must keep data locally but still want AWS features. Outposts stay connected to the main AWS Cloud for updates and backup.
            For example, a hospital or bank can use Outposts to store sensitive data on-site. It gives the same APIs and services as in the AWS Cloud.
         </p>
         <h2>📱 5. AWS Wavelength Zones</h2>
         <p>
            Wavelength Zones place AWS services inside telecom networks (like 4G or 5G towers). This gives ultra-low latency for mobile apps and devices.
            It helps build apps needing very fast responses, such as AR/VR, online games, or self-driving cars. 
            AWS works with telecom partners like Verizon, Vodafone, and Airtel for these zones.
            For example, when a user plays a mobile game, data travels only a short distance to a Wavelength Zone, making it very smooth and fast.
         </p>
         <h2>🧊 6. AWS Snowball (Data Transfer)</h2>
         <p>AWS Snowball is a physical data transfer device used to move large amounts of data (terabytes or petabytes) to AWS without using the public internet.</p>
         <p><strong>More details:</strong> It helps organizations migrate or back up huge datasets securely. Snowball devices come encrypted, tamper-resistant, and are ideal for areas with poor internet connectivity.</p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Snowball Edge Storage Optimized:</strong> Larger storage and some local compute.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowball Edge Compute Optimized:</strong> Includes GPU/CPU for analytics, ML, and edge processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowcone:</strong> Small portable device (8–14 TB) for remote or mobile use.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowmobile:</strong> A truck-sized data transfer solution (up to 100 PB).</li>

            <div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;">
               <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
               <p>A Public Cloud is a type of cloud that is owned and managed by companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. It is open for anyone to use through the internet. Many people and organizations share the same servers and storage, but their data stays separate. It is easy to start using and you only pay for what you use. Public clouds are cheaper and very good for small companies or startups. They are mostly used for hosting websites, apps, and online services.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;">
               <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
               <p> A Private Cloud is made for one single company or organization. It can be hosted inside the company’s office or by a trusted cloud provider. This cloud is not shared with others, so it gives more privacy and control. It is very secure and is often used for storing sensitive data. Big companies, banks, and government offices use private clouds to protect important information. It costs more than public cloud but gives full control over data and security.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;">
               <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
               <p>A Hybrid Cloud is a mix of public and private clouds working together. It allows data and applications to move between both types of clouds easily. This helps companies use the public cloud for simple tasks and the private cloud for secure work. It provides flexibility, better cost control, and improved performance. Many organizations use hybrid clouds to balance safety and scalability. For example, AWS Outposts or Azure Arc are used for hybrid cloud systems.</p>

         <h2>🧠 What is a Launch Template in AWS EC2?</h2>
         <p>
            A Launch Template in AWS is like a blueprint or saved configuration for launching EC2 instances (virtual servers).
            Instead of entering all settings manually every time you create a new EC2 instance, you can save those settings once in a launch template and reuse them easily later.
         </p>
         <h3>🔧 In Simple Words:</h3>
         <p>
            Think of it like saving your favorite “custom PC build” — with the same OS, instance type, key pair, security groups, and settings — so you can launch identical servers quickly anytime.
         </p>
         <h3>⚙️ A Launch Template can include:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>AMI (Amazon Machine Image)</strong> — which operating system or app base to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Instance Type</strong> — how much CPU and memory (e.g., t2.micro, t3.large).</li>
            <li><strong>Key Pair</strong> — for SSH login.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Groups</strong> — for firewall rules.</li>
            <li><strong>EBS Volumes</strong> — storage details.</li>
            <li><strong>Network settings</strong> — VPC, subnet, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>User Data</strong> — scripts to run when the instance starts (for setup automation).</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>🚀 Why Launch Templates Are Useful:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>🕒 <strong>Save time</strong> — no need to re-enter instance settings.</li>
            <li>🧩 <strong>Consistency</strong> — launch identical servers every time.</li>
            <li>🛠️ <strong>Automation</strong> — used by Auto Scaling Groups and EC2 Fleet.</li>
            <li>💰 <strong>Cost control</strong> — easily test, update, or version instance setups.</li>

                  A Virtual Machine, or VM, is a computer created with software inside a real physical computer. It has its own CPU, memory, and storage but runs virtually instead of physically. The Hypervisor is special software that creates and controls these virtual machines. It shares the real computer’s resources among several VMs so they can run at the same time. There are two kinds of hypervisors — Type 1 runs directly on hardware, and Type 2 runs on an operating system. In AWS, the Nitro hypervisor manages EC2 instances behind the scenes.

      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-300">
      An Amazon Machine Image, or AMI, is a ready-made template used to start a new EC2 instance. It includes an operating system, software, and configuration needed to run a server. When you launch an instance from an AMI, it looks exactly like the saved setup. This helps you create many identical servers quickly without manual setup. You can also make your own AMI from an existing server to use later. AWS Marketplace provides many pre-built AMIs like Ubuntu, WordPress, and Windows Server.</p>

      AWS Elastic Block Store, or EBS, is like a virtual hard disk for your EC2 instance. It stores your data safely and keeps it even after your server is stopped. You can use EBS to take snapshots, create backups, or attach it to another instance. It comes in different types for general use, high speed, or large data storage. Think of it as your computer’s hard drive but hosted in the cloud. EBS volumes make it easy to manage storage and recover data whenever needed.</p>

      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-300">A Public IP is an internet-facing address that lets your EC2 instance communicate with the outside world. It allows people to visit your website or connect to your server remotely. You can use it to host web applications, APIs, or connect through SSH and RDP. However, AWS-assigned public IPs are temporary and may change when you restart the instance. To keep a fixed address, you should use an Elastic IP. Public IPs are essential when your instance needs to be accessed from anywhere</p>

      A Private IP is used for internal communication inside your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It allows EC2 instances to talk securely without using the public internet. This is ideal for backend servers, databases, and internal applications. Private IPs protect your systems by keeping them invisible to the outside world. Every EC2 instance automatically gets one private IP when it starts. It’s like having an internal phone number used only inside your company’s network.</p>

      <h2>Elastic IPs</h2>
      <p>
      An Elastic IP address (EIP) is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
      Unlike regular IPs that change when an instance is stopped, an Elastic IP remains constant. 
      It allows you to quickly remap the address to another instance in case of failure, ensuring high availability.
      EIPs are particularly useful for hosting applications that require a fixed public endpoint.
      AWS charges for unused EIPs to encourage efficient IP usage.

    <h2>LAN (Local Area Network)</h2>
    <p>
        A LAN connects computers within a small area like a home, school, or office. 
        It provides high-speed communication because the devices are close to each other. 
        LAN is easy to set up, cheap to maintain, and supports file sharing, printer sharing, and fast internet access. 
        It mainly uses Ethernet cables or WiFi routers to connect devices in one building. 
        Security is strong since all data stays inside the local environment. 
        LAN works best for games, streaming, and business applications that need fast speed. 
        Troubleshooting is simple because the network is small. 
        It is reliable for everyday use but not suitable for connecting distant locations.

         <p>
            <strong>IPv4</strong> is an older version of the Internet Protocol that helps devices communicate on a network. It uses a 32-bit address system, which means it can create about 4.3 billion unique IP addresses (for example <code>192.168.1.1</code>). Because the number of internet users and devices has grown enormously, IPv4 addresses started running out.<br>

            <p>It uses a 32-bit address, meaning it can create 4.3 billion unique IP addresses.</p>
            <p>Format example: <code>192.168.1.1</code></p>
            <p>IPv4 addresses are written in four numbers separated by dots.</p>
            <p>It is the most widely used IP version today.</p>
            <p>Due to increasing internet devices, IPv4 addresses are almost finished.</p>
         </div>
         <h2>🌐 What is IPv6?</h2>
         <p><strong>IPv6</strong> is the newer version of the Internet Protocol created to solve that shortage. It uses a 128-bit address system (for example <code>2001:0db8:85a3::7334</code>), supports many more devices, and brings improvements in efficiency and security.</p>
         <div>
            <p><strong>✅ IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)</strong></p>
            <p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol.</p>
            <p>It uses a 128-bit address, meaning it can create a very large number of unique IP addresses (3.4×10<sup>38</sup>).</p>
            <p>Format example: <code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code></p>
            <p>IPv6 addresses are written in eight groups separated by colons.</p>

         <h2>🔑 Authentication</h2>
         <p>
            Authentication is the process of verifying who a person is before allowing access to a system. 
            It checks identity using methods like passwords, fingerprints, or OTP codes. 
            This step is always done first when a user tries to log in. 
            If authentication fails, the user is not allowed to enter the system. 
            In simple words, authentication confirms “Are you the real user?”
         </p>
         <h2>🛡️ Authorization </h2>
         <p>
            Authorization is the process of deciding what a user can do after they have logged in. 
            It controls permissions such as viewing data, editing information, or accessing admin features. 
            Each user gets different access based on their role in the system. 
            Authorization always happens after authentication is successful. 
            In simple words, authorization decides “What are you allowed to do?”

Agile methodology is a modern software development approach where the project is divided into small workable parts called sprints.<br>
Each sprint usually lasts two to four weeks and includes planning, development, testing, and review.<br>
The team works together daily and discusses progress and problems in short meetings.<br>
Customers can see the work regularly and give feedback anytime during the project.<br>
This allows quick changes if requirements change or new ideas come.<br>
Development and testing happen continuously, so issues are found early and fixed fast.<br>
Agile encourages teamwork between developers, testers, DevOps, and product owners.<br>
It improves communication and reduces misunderstandings.<br>
The product grows step-by-step and becomes better with every sprint.<br>
Agile helps deliver faster, improve quality, and satisfy customers more effectively.

    <h2>Waterfall Model</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
The Waterfall model is a traditional software development method where the entire project flows step by step in a fixed order.<br>
It begins with complete requirement gathering and then moves to system design after everything is clearly understood.<br>
Once the design is ready, the full development of the project starts without going back to earlier steps.<br>
After development is complete, the testing team checks the entire project at once to find errors or issues.<br>
Only after testing is finished, the project is delivered to the customer.<br>
In this model, changes are very difficult to make once the project has moved forward.<br>
Customers usually see the final product only at the end, not during development.<br>
This makes the process slow and rigid compared to modern methods.<br>
The Waterfall model is suitable only for projects with fixed and unchanging requirements.<br>
It works well for government or banking systems where stability is more important than flexibility.

  <h2>Monolithic Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    A monolithic architecture is a software design where the entire application is built as one single unit.<br>
    All features such as login, payment, database access, and UI run inside one big codebase.<br>
    Every module depends on the other, so even a small change requires rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.<br>
    This makes development slower as the project grows in size and complexity.<br>
    Testing becomes harder because everything is tightly connected and difficult to isolate.<br>
    If one part fails, the entire application may stop working.<br>
    Scaling is difficult because you must scale the whole app even if only one feature needs more resources.<br>
    Monolithic applications are simple to start and easy for small teams to manage.<br>
    However, they become large and harder to maintain over time.<br>
    They are suitable for small to medium-sized projects with stable requirements.

  <h2>Microservices Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    Microservices architecture is a modern approach where an application is divided into many small, independent services.<br>
    Each service focuses on a single function such as login, payment, search, or notifications.<br>
    These services run separately and communicate with each other using APIs.<br>
    If one service fails, the rest of the application continues to run normally.<br>
    Developers can update, deploy, and scale each service independently.<br>
    This makes scaling easier because only high-load services need extra resources.<br>
    Different services can be written in different programming languages if needed.<br>
    Testing becomes simpler as each service is small and isolated.<br>
    Microservices allow fast development for large and complex systems.<br>
    They are suitable for modern applications like e-commerce, cloud platforms, and banking systems.

  <h2>Docker (Simple English Explanation)</h2>
  <p>
    Docker is a tool that helps you run applications in a clean and separate environment called a container. 
    Normally, when we install software on a computer, it may cause version problems or dependency issues. 
    Docker avoids these problems by packing everything an application needs—code, libraries, runtime—into one container. 
    This container works the same on any machine, so the application runs without errors everywhere. 
    Developers use Docker to move applications easily from their laptop to servers or cloud. 
    It also helps teams work faster because containers start quickly and need very little memory. 
    Docker images are like templates, and containers are the running versions of those images. 
    Using Docker, we can run many small apps separately on the same machine without conflict. 
    It is one of the most important tools in DevOps for CI/CD pipelines. 
    Overall, Docker makes application deployment faster, easier, and more reliable.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Docker Image</h2>
  <p>
    A Docker image is like a blueprint or template used to create containers. 
    It contains everything an application needs, such as code, libraries, and system files. 
    You cannot change an image while it is running; it is always read-only. 
    Images are created only once and reused many times. 
    You can store images in Docker Hub or your private registry. 
    When you run an image, Docker uses it to start a container. 
    Think of a Docker image like a cake recipe that tells how to make a cake. 
    The recipe never changes; it only describes how the cake should be. 
    Developers use images to make sure their app runs the same in all environments. 
    In short, an image is the package that contains the app and all its dependencies.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Docker Container</h2>
  <p>
    A Docker container is the running version of a Docker image. 
    It is like the actual cake made from the recipe. 
    Containers run the application in a fully isolated environment. 
    Each container has its own file system, processes, and configuration. 
    Containers are lightweight and start very fast. 
    You can start, stop, restart, and delete containers easily. 
    Containers use the image as a base but can have changes during runtime. 
    Multiple containers can run from the same image at the same time. 
    They do not affect each other, making them safe and independent. 
    In simple words, a container is an alive, working app created from an image.

  <h2>Inbound Rules</h2>
  <p>
    Inbound rules control all the traffic coming **into** your server or instance. 
    They decide which outside systems are allowed to connect to your machine. 
    For example, allowing port 22 means someone can connect using SSH. 
    Allowing port 80 or 443 lets users open your website. 
    If a port is not allowed in inbound rules, no one can reach your server on that port. 
    Inbound rules act like a security guard who checks who can enter the building. 
    You can allow traffic from specific IPs or from anywhere. 
    Inbound rules protect your server from unwanted access. 
    Every inbound rule has a protocol, port range, and source. 
    In simple words, inbound rules decide what type of incoming traffic is allowed.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Outbound Rules</h2>
  <p>
    Outbound rules control all the traffic going **out** from your server. 
    They decide which destinations your server is allowed to connect to. 
    For example, allowing outbound internet means your server can download updates. 
    If an outbound port is blocked, your server cannot send data on that port. 
    Outbound rules act like a security guard who checks who can leave the building. 
    They help prevent your server from sending data to unsafe locations. 
    Most servers allow all outbound traffic by default. 
    You can restrict outbound rules to improve security. 
    Every outbound rule has a protocol, port range, and destination. 
    In simple words, outbound rules decide what type of outgoing traffic is allowed.

  <h2>AWS DevOps Agent – Complete Guide</h2>
  <p>
    AWS DevOps Agent is a small software program that runs on your server, usually an EC2 instance. 
    It connects your server to AWS DevOps services like CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and SSM. 
    The agent’s main job is to receive tasks from AWS services and execute them on the server. 
    For example, when a new version of your application is ready in CodeDeploy, the agent downloads 
    the files, runs scripts to stop the old version, installs the new version, and starts the app. 
    It can also send logs back to AWS so you can track what happened during deployment. 
    AWS DevOps Agent starts automatically when your server starts, as it is enabled as a service. 
    You can also manually start, stop, or check the agent using system commands. 
    This agent is very useful for DevOps engineers because it automates repetitive tasks like deployment, 
    updates, configuration, and testing. It ensures that deployments are consistent, reliable, and fast. 
    Using AWS DevOps Agent saves time, reduces errors, and allows teams to implement continuous integration 
    and continuous delivery efficiently. Overall, it is an essential tool for modern DevOps pipelines.

  <h2>How to Start and Use AWS DevOps Agent</h2>
  <p>
    AWS DevOps Agent can be installed on Amazon Linux or other Linux servers. 
    After installation, it is enabled as a service, so it starts automatically when the server boots. 
    You can check its status using commands like <code>sudo systemctl status codedeploy-agent</code> or 
    <code>sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent</code>. To manually start the agent, use 
    <code>sudo systemctl start codedeploy-agent</code>. DevOps engineers use the agent to connect the server 
    to pipelines like CodePipeline or deployments via CodeDeploy. It can run deployment scripts, install 
    updates, and configure applications automatically. Logs and status updates are sent back to AWS so the 
    team can monitor progress. The agent also works with SSM to run commands or manage servers remotely. 
    By using this agent, DevOps engineers can automate repetitive tasks, reduce human errors, and 
    implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment smoothly. It makes the whole software delivery 
    process faster and more reliable, which is critical for production systems.
