        <h2>☁️ Cloud Computing</h2>
        <p>
            Cloud Computing is a technology that delivers computing services—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software—over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. It eliminates the need for organizations to own and maintain physical infrastructure,
            providing flexibility and cost savings. Cloud services are typically categorized into Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Leading providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google
            Cloud offer scalable and secure environments for hosting and deploying applications globally. The primary aim of cloud computing is to provide easy access to IT resources, scalability, and business continuity.

        <h2>🧑‍💻 DevOps</h2>
        <p>
            DevOps is a modern software engineering approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to work collaboratively throughout the entire software lifecycle. It focuses on automation, continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD),
            and monitoring to deliver high-quality applications faster. DevOps encourages a culture of communication and feedback between teams, helping organizations respond quickly to market changes. By using tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes,
            it streamlines workflows and reduces human errors in deployment. The main goal of DevOps is to achieve faster delivery, better reliability, and consistent improvement in software performance.

    <h2>Main Cloud Services</h2>
    <p>
        Cloud computing is mainly divided into three types of services. 
        These services help individuals and companies use computing resources 
        like servers, storage, and software over the internet instead of owning 
        physical hardware. Each service level offers different control and responsibility.

        <strong>In simple words:</strong><br>
        IaaS gives you raw infrastructure, PaaS gives you a development platform, 
        and SaaS gives you ready-to-use software. As you move from IaaS to SaaS, 
        user responsibility decreases while provider responsibility increases.

    <section class="card" id="regions">
        <h2>🌍 1. AWS Regions</h2>
        <p>
            AWS Regions are large geographical areas where Amazon has built data centers. Each region is separate to provide better security and reliability. Regions help users choose where they want to store data and run applications. For example, there are AWS
            Regions in Mumbai, London, and Tokyo. If your business is in India, using the Mumbai Region gives faster performance. Regions also help follow local data laws.
        </p>
        <h2>🏗️ 2. AWS Availability Zones (AZs)</h2>
        <p>
            Each AWS Region has multiple Availability Zones. An Availability Zone is a group of one or more data centers inside a region. They are built close together but separately, so if one fails, others keep running. This setup improves high availability and
            disaster recovery. For example, the Mumbai Region has 3 AZs. If one AZ goes down, your app still runs using another AZ. It helps businesses stay online always.
        </p>
        <h2>🏙️ 3. AWS Local Zones</h2>
        <p>
            Local Zones are smaller AWS data centers placed near big cities. They help reduce delay (latency) for apps that need fast response. Data does not travel far to main regions, so apps like gaming, video streaming, and healthcare run faster. For example,
            AWS has a Local Zone in Mumbai to serve local users quickly. It’s great for real-time and media-based apps. Local Zones bring cloud power closer to end users for a smoother experience.
        </p>
        <h2>🏢 4. AWS Outposts</h2>
        <p>
            AWS Outposts bring AWS servers and tools directly into your own building or data center. It’s like having a small AWS inside your office. It helps companies that must keep data locally but still want AWS features. Outposts stay connected to the main AWS
            Cloud for updates and backup. For example, a hospital or bank can use Outposts to store sensitive data on-site. It gives the same APIs and services as in the AWS Cloud.
        </p>
        <h2>📱 5. AWS Wavelength Zones</h2>
        <p>
            Wavelength Zones place AWS services inside telecom networks (like 4G or 5G towers). This gives ultra-low latency for mobile apps and devices. It helps build apps needing very fast responses, such as AR/VR, online games, or self-driving cars. AWS works
            with telecom partners like Verizon, Vodafone, and Airtel for these zones. For example, when a user plays a mobile game, data travels only a short distance to a Wavelength Zone, making it very smooth and fast.
        </p>
        <h2>🧊 6. AWS Snowball (Data Transfer)</h2>
        <p>AWS Snowball is a physical data transfer device used to move large amounts of data (terabytes or petabytes) to AWS without using the public internet.</p>
        <p><strong>More details:</strong> It helps organizations migrate or back up huge datasets securely. Snowball devices come encrypted, tamper-resistant, and are ideal for areas with poor internet connectivity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Snowball Edge Storage Optimized:</strong> Larger storage and some local compute.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowball Edge Compute Optimized:</strong> Includes GPU/CPU for analytics, ML, and edge processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowcone:</strong> Small portable device (8–14 TB) for remote or mobile use.</li>
            <li><strong>Snowmobile:</strong> A truck-sized data transfer solution (up to 100 PB).</li>

        <div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;">
            <div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
                <p>A Public Cloud is a type of cloud that is owned and managed by companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. It is open for anyone to use through the internet. Many people and organizations share the same servers
                    and storage, but their data stays separate. It is easy to start using and you only pay for what you use. Public clouds are cheaper and very good for small companies or startups. They are mostly used for hosting websites, apps, and
                    online services.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
                <p> A Private Cloud is made for one single company or organization. It can be hosted inside the company’s office or by a trusted cloud provider. This cloud is not shared with others, so it gives more privacy and control. It is very secure
                    and is often used for storing sensitive data. Big companies, banks, and government offices use private clouds to protect important information. It costs more than public cloud but gives full control over data and security.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="flex: 1; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
                <p>A Hybrid Cloud is a mix of public and private clouds working together. It allows data and applications to move between both types of clouds easily. This helps companies use the public cloud for simple tasks and the private cloud for secure
                    work. It provides flexibility, better cost control, and improved performance. Many organizations use hybrid clouds to balance safety and scalability. For example, AWS Outposts or Azure Arc are used for hybrid cloud systems.</p>

            A Launch Template in AWS is like a blueprint or saved configuration for launching EC2 instances (virtual servers). Instead of entering all settings manually every time you create a new EC2 instance, you can save those settings once in a launch template
            and reuse them easily later.
        </p>
        <h3>🔧 In Simple Words:</h3>
        <p>
            Think of it like saving your favorite “custom PC build” — with the same OS, instance type, key pair, security groups, and settings — so you can launch identical servers quickly anytime.
        </p>
        <h3>⚙️ A Launch Template can include:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AMI (Amazon Machine Image)</strong> — which operating system or app base to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Instance Type</strong> — how much CPU and memory (e.g., t2.micro, t3.large).</li>
            <li><strong>Key Pair</strong> — for SSH login.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Groups</strong> — for firewall rules.</li>
            <li><strong>EBS Volumes</strong> — storage details.</li>
            <li><strong>Network settings</strong> — VPC, subnet, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>User Data</strong> — scripts to run when the instance starts (for setup automation).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>🚀 Why Launch Templates Are Useful:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>🕒 <strong>Save time</strong> — no need to re-enter instance settings.</li>
            <li>🧩 <strong>Consistency</strong> — launch identical servers every time.</li>
            <li>🛠️ <strong>Automation</strong> — used by Auto Scaling Groups and EC2 Fleet.</li>
            <li>💰 <strong>Cost control</strong> — easily test, update, or version instance setups.</li>
        </ul>

                        A Virtual Machine, or VM, is a computer created with software inside a real physical computer. It has its own CPU, memory, and storage but runs virtually instead of physically. The Hypervisor is special software that creates and controls these virtual
                        machines. It shares the real computer’s resources among several VMs so they can run at the same time. There are two kinds of hypervisors — Type 1 runs directly on hardware, and Type 2 runs on an operating system. In AWS, the Nitro
                        hypervisor manages EC2 instances behind the scenes.

            A Private IP is used for internal communication inside your AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It allows EC2 instances to talk securely without using the public internet. This is ideal for backend servers, databases, and internal applications. Private IPs
            protect your systems by keeping them invisible to the outside world. Every EC2 instance automatically gets one private IP when it starts. It’s like having an internal phone number used only inside your company’s network.</p>

        <h2>Elastic IPs</h2>
        <p>
            An Elastic IP address (EIP) is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. Unlike regular IPs that change when an instance is stopped, an Elastic IP remains constant. It allows you to quickly remap the address to another instance
            in case of failure, ensuring high availability. EIPs are particularly useful for hosting applications that require a fixed public endpoint. AWS charges for unused EIPs to encourage efficient IP usage.

        <h2>WAN (Wide Area Network)</h2>
        <p>
            A WAN connects devices across countries and continents. It is the largest type of network and is mainly used by global companies. WAN makes remote work possible and connects offices around the world. It uses satellites, fiber cables, and telecom networks.
            The internet itself is a WAN, making communication possible anywhere. WAN lets companies store data in one centralized location and access it from different countries. Although WAN is essential for global operations, it is slower than LAN
            and MAN due to long distances.

            <strong>IPv4</strong> is an older version of the Internet Protocol that helps devices communicate on a network. It uses a 32-bit address system, which means it can create about 4.3 billion unique IP addresses (for example <code>192.168.1.1</code>).
            Because the number of internet users and devices has grown enormously, IPv4 addresses started running out.

        A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is used to make websites load faster and work smoothly. It stores website content like images, videos, CSS, and JavaScript files on many servers located in different places around the world. When a user opens a website,
        the CDN delivers the content from the nearest server instead of a far-away main server. This reduces loading time and improves website speed. Amazon CloudFront is AWS’s CDN service that delivers content securely with low latency and high performance.
        CloudFront works with services like S3, EC2, and Load Balancer to distribute content globally. Overall, CDN and CloudFront improve performance, reliability, and user experience.
    </p>
    <h4>1.  Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</h4>

    <p>Amazon EC2 is a virtual server service that allows you to run applications in the cloud. You can choose different operating systems like Linux or Windows and select the size of your server depending on your needs. EC2 gives flexibility to start, stop,
        or resize instances at any time, and you only pay for what you use. Storage can be attached using EBS, and networking is secured with security groups. It supports Auto Scaling and Load Balancing to handle traffic changes. Custom machine images
        (AMIs) can be created for faster deployments. EC2 is widely used for hosting applications, websites, and backend services.</p>

    <h4>2. Simple Storage Service (S3)</h4>

    <p>Amazon S3 is an object storage service that allows you to store unlimited amounts of data in buckets. It is highly durable with eleven nines (99.999999999%) of data protection, making it reliable for critical files. S3 supports versioning, so you
        can keep older versions of files, and lifecycle rules to automatically move or delete data. Files stored in S3 can be accessed via URLs and can also be encrypted for security. It is commonly used for storing backups, logs, images, and videos,
        and it can even host static websites. S3 integrates well with CloudFront for global content delivery.</p>

    <h4>3. Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h4>

    <p>AWS IAM helps you manage who can access AWS services and resources. With IAM, you can create users, groups, and roles, and then attach policies to give them specific permissions. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be added for better security.
        Instead of using the root account, it is always recommended to create IAM users with least privilege access. IAM is free and works with all AWS services. It also supports federated access, meaning you can integrate external login systems like
        Active Directory or Google. IAM plays a key role in securing your AWS environment.</p>

    <h4>4. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)</h4>

    <p>Elastic Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. This improves both availability and fault tolerance. AWS offers three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer for Layer 7 traffic (HTTP/HTTPS),
        Network Load Balancer for high-performance Layer 4 traffic (TCP/UDP), and Classic Load Balancer, which is the older version. ELB performs health checks to ensure traffic only goes to healthy servers. It supports SSL/TLS for secure connections,
        sticky sessions for user consistency, and integrates with Auto Scaling to handle traffic spikes.</p>

    <h4> 5. Elastic Beanstalk</h4>

    <p>Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure. Developers just upload their code, and Beanstalk automatically handles EC2, load balancers, Auto Scaling,
        and RDS if required. It supports multiple programming languages such as Java, Python, PHP, and Node.js. Beanstalk provides monitoring via CloudWatch and makes deployments easier with blue/green strategies. It is widely used for quick application
        hosting where developers want to focus only on code, not on servers.</p>

    <h4> 6. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)</h4>

    <p>Auto Scaling Groups ensure that the right number of EC2 instances are running at any time. They automatically add instances when demand increases and remove them when demand decreases, saving costs. ASGs improve availability by replacing unhealthy
        instances and maintaining minimum numbers of servers. You can define scaling policies based on CPU usage, memory, or custom CloudWatch metrics. They work closely with load balancers to distribute traffic and provide a reliable, cost-efficient
        infrastructure setup.</p>

    <h4> 7. Elastic Block Storage (EBS)</h4>

    <p>Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. It acts like a hard drive in the cloud and stores data persistently, even if the EC2 instance is stopped. Different volume types are available such as SSDs for
        performance and HDDs for cost-efficient storage. You can resize volumes, take snapshots for backup, and enable encryption for data security. EBS is commonly used for operating systems, databases, and any workload that requires fast, persistent
        storage.</p>

    <h4> 8. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h4>

    <p>Amazon VPC allows you to create a private network within AWS. You can define subnets as public or private, attach Internet Gateways for public access, and use NAT Gateways for controlled internet access from private subnets. Security is managed using
        Security Groups and Network ACLs. Route tables define how traffic flows inside the VPC. You can also connect your VPC to on-premises networks using VPN or Direct Connect. Each AWS account comes with a default VPC, but you can create custom VPCs
        for better security and control.</p>

    <h4> 9. Amazon Machine Images (AMI)</h4>

    <p>An Amazon Machine Image is a template used to create EC2 instances. An AMI contains the operating system, application server, and custom software if needed. AWS provides public AMIs, but you can also create your own for standardizing deployments.
        AMIs can be copied between regions and shared with other accounts. The main benefit of AMIs is faster and consistent server launches. They are essential when deploying multiple servers with the same configuration.</p>

    <h4> 10. Simple Notification Service (SNS)</h4>

    <p>Amazon SNS is a messaging service that uses a publish/subscribe model. Applications or users can publish messages to a topic, and subscribers such as email, SMS, SQS, or Lambda functions receive those messages. SNS is scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.
        It is widely used for sending alerts, notifications, and automated messages. For example, CloudWatch alarms can use SNS to notify admins about system issues. SNS ensures fast and reliable message delivery across applications.</p>

    <h4> 11. AWS CodePipeline</h4>

    <p>AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. A pipeline consists of stages such as source, build, test, and deploy. CodePipeline integrates
        with AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and third-party tools like GitHub and Jenkins. It also supports manual approvals for production releases. CodePipeline helps organizations deliver software quickly and reliably, following
        DevOps practices.</p>

    <h4> 12. Relational Database Service (RDS)</h4>

    <p>Amazon RDS is a managed database service that supports popular engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB. AWS handles backups, patching, and updates, reducing admin work. RDS provides high availability with Multi-AZ deployments
        and scaling with read replicas. Databases can be encrypted, monitored with CloudWatch, and integrated with IAM for security. It is commonly used for web and enterprise applications needing relational databases without manual maintenance.</p>

    <h4> 13. CloudWatch</h4>

    <p>Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service for AWS resources and applications. It collects metrics such as CPU usage, memory, and disk I/O, as well as logs from applications. You can create alarms to notify or trigger actions when
        thresholds are crossed. CloudWatch integrates with SNS for alerts and with Auto Scaling for automated adjustments. It also provides dashboards for visualization. CloudWatch is essential for monitoring system health and performance in AWS.</p>

    <h4> 14. Route 53</h4>

    <p>Amazon Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) service. It can register domain names, route internet traffic to applications, and check the health of resources. Route 53 supports routing policies like weighted, latency-based, failover, and
        geolocation routing. It integrates with other AWS services like S3, ELB, and CloudFront. Route 53 is highly available, secure, and widely used for managing website traffic globally.</p>

        <h2>🔑 Authentication</h2>
        <p>
            Authentication is the process of verifying who a person is before allowing access to a system. It checks identity using methods like passwords, fingerprints, or OTP codes. This step is always done first when a user tries to log in. If authentication fails,
            the user is not allowed to enter the system. In simple words, authentication confirms “Are you the real user?”
        </p>
        <h2>🛡️ Authorization </h2>
        <p>
            Authorization is the process of deciding what a user can do after they have logged in. It controls permissions such as viewing data, editing information, or accessing admin features. Each user gets different access based on their role in the system. Authorization
            always happens after authentication is successful. In simple words, authorization decides “What are you allowed to do?”

    <h1>Agile vs Waterfall (Each as a 10-line Paragraph)</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Agile methodology is a modern software development approach where the project is divided into small workable parts called sprints.
            <br> Each sprint usually lasts two to four weeks and includes planning, development, testing, and review.
            <br> The team works together daily and discusses progress and problems in short meetings.
            <br> Customers can see the work regularly and give feedback anytime during the project.
            <br> This allows quick changes if requirements change or new ideas come.
            <br> Development and testing happen continuously, so issues are found early and fixed fast.
            <br> Agile encourages teamwork between developers, testers, DevOps, and product owners.
            <br> It improves communication and reduces misunderstandings.
            <br> The product grows step-by-step and becomes better with every sprint.
            <br> Agile helps deliver faster, improve quality, and satisfy customers more effectively.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Waterfall Model</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The Waterfall model is a traditional software development method where the entire project flows step by step in a fixed order.
            <br> It begins with complete requirement gathering and then moves to system design after everything is clearly understood.
            <br> Once the design is ready, the full development of the project starts without going back to earlier steps.
            <br> After development is complete, the testing team checks the entire project at once to find errors or issues.
            <br> Only after testing is finished, the project is delivered to the customer.
            <br> In this model, changes are very difficult to make once the project has moved forward.
            <br> Customers usually see the final product only at the end, not during development.
            <br> This makes the process slow and rigid compared to modern methods.
            <br> The Waterfall model is suitable only for projects with fixed and unchanging requirements.
            <br> It works well for government or banking systems where stability is more important than flexibility.

        <h2>Monolithic Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            A monolithic architecture is a software design where the entire application is built as one single unit.
            <br> All features such as login, payment, database access, and UI run inside one big codebase.
            <br> Every module depends on the other, so even a small change requires rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.
            <br> This makes development slower as the project grows in size and complexity.
            <br> Testing becomes harder because everything is tightly connected and difficult to isolate.
            <br> If one part fails, the entire application may stop working.
            <br> Scaling is difficult because you must scale the whole app even if only one feature needs more resources.
            <br> Monolithic applications are simple to start and easy for small teams to manage.
            <br> However, they become large and harder to maintain over time.
            <br> They are suitable for small to medium-sized projects with stable requirements.

    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.6;">
        <h2>Microservices Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            Microservices architecture is a modern approach where an application is divided into many small, independent services.
            <br> Each service focuses on a single function such as login, payment, search, or notifications.
            <br> These services run separately and communicate with each other using APIs.
            <br> If one service fails, the rest of the application continues to run normally.
            <br> Developers can update, deploy, and scale each service independently.
            <br> This makes scaling easier because only high-load services need extra resources.
            <br> Different services can be written in different programming languages if needed.
            <br> Testing becomes simpler as each service is small and isolated.
            <br> Microservices allow fast development for large and complex systems.
            <br> They are suitable for modern applications like e-commerce, cloud platforms, and banking systems.

        <h2>Docker (Simple English Explanation)</h2>
        <p>
            Docker is a tool that helps you run applications in a clean and separate environment called a container. Normally, when we install software on a computer, it may cause version problems or dependency issues. Docker avoids these problems by packing everything
            an application needs—code, libraries, runtime—into one container. This container works the same on any machine, so the application runs without errors everywhere. Developers use Docker to move applications easily from their laptop to servers
            or cloud. It also helps teams work faster because containers start quickly and need very little memory. Docker images are like templates, and containers are the running versions of those images. Using Docker, we can run many small apps separately
            on the same machine without conflict. It is one of the most important tools in DevOps for CI/CD pipelines. Overall, Docker makes application deployment faster, easier, and more reliable.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Docker Image</h2>
        <p>
            A Docker image is like a blueprint or template used to create containers. It contains everything an application needs, such as code, libraries, and system files. You cannot change an image while it is running; it is always read-only. Images are created
            only once and reused many times. You can store images in Docker Hub or your private registry. When you run an image, Docker uses it to start a container. Think of a Docker image like a cake recipe that tells how to make a cake. The recipe
            never changes; it only describes how the cake should be. Developers use images to make sure their app runs the same in all environments. In short, an image is the package that contains the app and all its dependencies.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Docker Container</h2>
        <p>
            A Docker container is the running version of a Docker image. It is like the actual cake made from the recipe. Containers run the application in a fully isolated environment. Each container has its own file system, processes, and configuration. Containers
            are lightweight and start very fast. You can start, stop, restart, and delete containers easily. Containers use the image as a base but can have changes during runtime. Multiple containers can run from the same image at the same time. They
            do not affect each other, making them safe and independent. In simple words, a container is an alive, working app created from an image.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>Inbound Rules</h2>
        <p>
            Inbound rules control all the traffic coming **into** your server or instance. They decide which outside systems are allowed to connect to your machine. For example, allowing port 22 means someone can connect using SSH. Allowing port 80 or 443 lets users
            open your website. If a port is not allowed in inbound rules, no one can reach your server on that port. Inbound rules act like a security guard who checks who can enter the building. You can allow traffic from specific IPs or from anywhere.
            Inbound rules protect your server from unwanted access. Every inbound rule has a protocol, port range, and source. In simple words, inbound rules decide what type of incoming traffic is allowed.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Outbound Rules</h2>
        <p>
            Outbound rules control all the traffic going **out** from your server. They decide which destinations your server is allowed to connect to. For example, allowing outbound internet means your server can download updates. If an outbound port is blocked,
            your server cannot send data on that port. Outbound rules act like a security guard who checks who can leave the building. They help prevent your server from sending data to unsafe locations. Most servers allow all outbound traffic by default.
            You can restrict outbound rules to improve security. Every outbound rule has a protocol, port range, and destination. In simple words, outbound rules decide what type of outgoing traffic is allowed.

        <h2>AWS DevOps Agent – Complete Guide</h2>
        <p>
            AWS DevOps Agent is a small software program that runs on your server, usually an EC2 instance. It connects your server to AWS DevOps services like CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and SSM. The agent’s main job is to receive tasks from AWS services
            and execute them on the server. For example, when a new version of your application is ready in CodeDeploy, the agent downloads the files, runs scripts to stop the old version, installs the new version, and starts the app. It can also send
            logs back to AWS so you can track what happened during deployment. AWS DevOps Agent starts automatically when your server starts, as it is enabled as a service. You can also manually start, stop, or check the agent using system commands. This
            agent is very useful for DevOps engineers because it automates repetitive tasks like deployment, updates, configuration, and testing. It ensures that deployments are consistent, reliable, and fast. Using AWS DevOps Agent saves time, reduces
            errors, and allows teams to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery efficiently. Overall, it is an essential tool for modern DevOps pipelines.

    <div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 30px;">
        <h2>How to Start and Use AWS DevOps Agent</h2>
        <p>
            AWS DevOps Agent can be installed on Amazon Linux or other Linux servers. After installation, it is enabled as a service, so it starts automatically when the server boots. You can check its status using commands like <code>sudo systemctl status codedeploy-agent</code>            or
            <code>sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent</code>. To manually start the agent, use
            <code>sudo systemctl start codedeploy-agent</code>. DevOps engineers use the agent to connect the server to pipelines like CodePipeline or deployments via CodeDeploy. It can run deployment scripts, install updates, and configure applications
            automatically. Logs and status updates are sent back to AWS so the team can monitor progress. The agent also works with SSM to run commands or manage servers remotely. By using this agent, DevOps engineers can automate repetitive tasks, reduce
            human errors, and implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment smoothly. It makes the whole software delivery process faster and more reliable, which is critical for production systems.

        <h2>AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service)</h2>
        <p>
            AWS SQS is a fully managed message queue service that helps different parts of an application communicate without waiting for each other. It stores messages safely until the receiving service is ready to process them. This makes applications reliable
            and scalable, especially during high traffic. For example, in an e-commerce application, when a user places an order, the order details are sent to SQS. Later, the email service and delivery service read the message from SQS and complete their
            tasks independently.
        </p>

        <h2>AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)</h2>
        <p>
            AWS SNS is a fully managed messaging service used to send messages or notifications to many users or systems at the same time. It works on a publish and subscribe model, where one service sends a message and many subscribers receive it instantly. SNS
            is mainly used for alerts and notifications. For example, if a server goes down, SNS can send an alert message to email, SMS, or another application. This helps teams take quick action and keep systems running smoothly.
