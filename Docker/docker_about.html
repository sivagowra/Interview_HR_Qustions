<h1>Docker – Containerization Platform</h1>

<p>
Docker is a containerization platform used to build, package, and run applications in lightweight containers.
A container includes application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies, ensuring the application runs
the same in development, testing, and production environments.
</p>

<h2>Resource Isolation in Docker</h2>
<p>
Docker provides resource isolation using Linux kernel features such as namespaces and cgroups.
Each container runs in its own isolated environment with separate process space, network stack,
and file system view. CPU, memory, and disk usage can be limited per container to avoid one container
consuming all host resources.
</p>

<h2>Docker Networking</h2>

<h3>Bridge Network</h3>
<p>
The bridge network is the default Docker network. Containers connected to a bridge network can
communicate with each other using container names. It provides isolation from the host network.
</p>

<h3>Host Network</h3>
<p>
In host networking, the container shares the host’s network stack and uses the same IP address
as the host. This provides high performance but reduces isolation.
</p>

<h3>Overlay Network</h3>
<p>
Overlay networks are used in Docker Swarm to enable communication between containers running
on different Docker hosts over a virtual network.
</p>

<h2>Docker Volumes – Data Persistence</h2>

<h3>Volumes</h3>
<p>
Docker volumes are managed by Docker and stored outside the container filesystem.
They are the preferred method for persisting data and are reusable across containers.
</p>

<h3>Bind Mounts</h3>
<p>
Bind mounts map a host directory directly into a container.
They allow direct access to host files but tightly couple the container to the host system.
</p>

<h3>tmpfs Mounts</h3>
<p>
tmpfs mounts store data in memory only and are removed when the container stops.
They are commonly used for temporary or sensitive data.
</p>

<h2>Docker Health Checks</h2>
<p>
Docker supports health checks to monitor the state of running containers.
Health checks periodically execute commands inside the container to verify application health.
If a check fails, the container is marked as unhealthy.
</p>

<h2>Configuration Management in Docker</h2>
<p>
Docker applications can be configured using environment variables, .env files, and mounted
configuration files. This approach separates configuration from application code and enables
reusability across different environments.
</p>

<h2>Secrets Management in Docker</h2>
<p>
Docker provides secret management (especially in Docker Swarm) to securely store sensitive data
such as passwords, API keys, and tokens. Secrets are encrypted and accessible only to authorized containers.
</p>

<h2>Docker Jobs and One-Time Tasks</h2>
<p>
Docker containers can run one-time tasks such as database migrations, backups, and batch processing.
Once the task completes, the container exits automatically.
</p>

<h2>Container Lifecycle in Docker</h2>
<p>
The Docker container lifecycle includes states such as created, running, paused, stopped, and deleted.
A container starts from an image and stops when its main process exits or fails.
</p>

<h2>Resource Limits in Docker</h2>
<p>
Docker allows setting CPU and memory limits for containers to ensure fair resource usage.
These limits help maintain system stability and prevent resource exhaustion.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Docker simplifies application deployment by providing lightweight, isolated, and portable containers.
It ensures consistent environments, efficient resource utilization, and fast scalability, making it
a core technology in modern DevOps practices.
