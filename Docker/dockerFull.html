<h1>What is Docker?</h1>

<section>
    <p>
        Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
        Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so
        you can deliver software quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
        With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage
        your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping,
        testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between
        writing code and running it in production.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Docker Platform</h2>

    <p>
        Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated
        environment called a container. The isolation and security lets you run many
        containers simultaneously on a given host.
    </p>

    <p>
        Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application,
        so you don't need to rely on what's installed on the host. You can share containers
        while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container
        that works in the same way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your containers:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.</li>
        <li>The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application.</li>
        <li>
            When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment,
            as a container or an orchestrated service. This works the same whether your
            production environment is a local data center, a cloud provider, or a hybrid
            of the two.
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What Can I Use Docker For?</h2>

    <h3>Fast, Consistent Delivery of Your Applications</h3>

    <p>
        Docker streamlines the development lifecycle by allowing developers to work in
        standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications
        and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous
        delivery (CI/CD) workflows.
    </p>

    <p>Consider the following example scenario:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues
            using Docker containers.
        </li>
        <li>
            They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and run
            automated and manual tests.
        </li>
        <li>
            When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment
            and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation.
        </li>
        <li>
            When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as
            pushing the updated image to the production environment.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Responsive Deployment and Scaling</h3>

    <p>
        Docker's container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker
        containers can run on a developer's local laptop, on physical or virtual machines
        in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Docker's portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically
        manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as
        business needs dictate, in near real time.
    </p>

    <h3>Running More Workloads on the Same Hardware</h3>

    <p>
        Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative
        to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your server capacity
        to achieve your business goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium
        deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Docker Architecture</h2>

    <p>
        Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the
        Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and
        distributing your Docker containers.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a
        Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets
        or a network interface.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications
        consisting of a set of containers.
    </p>

<section>
    <h3>The Docker Daemon</h3>

    <p>
        The Docker daemon (<code>dockerd</code>) listens for Docker API requests and manages
        Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
    </p>

    <p>
        A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>The Docker Client</h3>

    <p>
        The Docker client (<code>docker</code>) is the primary way that many Docker users
        interact with Docker.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you use commands such as <code>docker run</code>, the client sends these
        commands to <code>dockerd</code>, which carries them out.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>docker</code> command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can
        communicate with more than one daemon.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Docker Desktop</h3>

    <p>
        Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac, Windows, or Linux
        environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and
        microservices.
    </p>

    <p>
        Docker Desktop includes the Docker daemon (<code>dockerd</code>), the Docker client
        (<code>docker</code>), Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and
        Credential Helper.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Docker Registries</h3>

    <p>
        A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that
        anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on Docker Hub by default.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can even run your own private registry.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you use the <code>docker pull</code> or <code>docker run</code> commands,
        Docker pulls the required images from your configured registry.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you use the <code>docker push</code> command, Docker pushes your image to
        your configured registry.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Docker Objects</h3>

    <p>
        When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks,
        volumes, plugins, and other objects.
    </p>

    <h4>Images</h4>



    <p>
       An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker
container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional
customization. For example, you may build an image that is based on the Ubuntu image 
but includes the Apache web server and your application, as well as the
configuration details needed to make your application run.

    </p>

    <p>
       You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others
and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile
with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run
it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you
change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have
changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small,
and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.
    </p>

    <h4>Containers</h4>
<p>
A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop,
move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a
container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new
image based on its current state.</p>
 <p>By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and
its host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage,
or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host
machine.</p>
    <p>
     A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you
provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to
its state that aren't stored in persistent storage disappear.
    </p>
   

    <h5>Example docker run command</h5>

    <pre>
docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
    </pre>

    <ol>
        <li>Docker pulls the Ubuntu image if it is not present locally.</li>
        <li>Docker creates a new container.</li>
        <li>Docker allocates a read-write filesystem.</li>
        <li>Docker creates a network interface and assigns an IP address.</li>
        <li>Docker starts the container and runs /bin/bash.</li>
        <li>Exiting stops the container but does not remove it.</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>The Underlying Technology</h2>

    <p>
        Docker is written in the Go programming language and uses Linux kernel features
        such as namespaces to provide isolation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access is limited
        to that namespace.
    </p>
