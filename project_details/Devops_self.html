   <div class="self-introduction">
    <p>Good morning, my name is <strong>Sivannarayana Gowra</strong>.</p>

    <p>
        I am a <strong>DevOps Engineer</strong> with more than 2 years of experience 
        in AWS Cloud and DevOps tools.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have hands-on experience in AWS services like EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, RDS, ELB, 
        Auto Scaling, and CloudWatch.
    </p>

    <p>
        I work on CI/CD tool using Git, Github Actions, Maven, and Docker to automate 
        build and deployment processes.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have good experience with Docker for 
        containerized applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also use Terraform for Infrastructure as Code and server automation.
    </p>

    <p>
        I work closely with developers to 
        deploy applications, monitor systems, and ensure high availability and security 
        of the infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am a quick learner, hard-working, and always interested in learning new cloud 
        and DevOps technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to grow as a DevOps / Cloud Engineer and contribute to building 
        reliable and scalable systems.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>
