    <h4>Q1. What is DevOps, and how is it different from Agile?</h4>

<p>DevOps is about joining development and operations teams.</p>
<p>Goal is faster software delivery.</p>
<p>Uses automation tools like Jenkins, Docker, Terraform.</p>
<p>Agile is about software development method (Scrum, Kanban).</p>

<p>Agile = focus on coding and testing.</p>

<p>DevOps = focus on delivery and running software.</p>

<p>Agile is about team collaboration.</p>

<p>DevOps is about automation and monitoring.</p>

<p>Agile = small sprints.</p>

<p>DevOps = continuous delivery.</p>

<h4>Q5. Can you explain blue-green and canary deployment strategies?</h4>

<p>Blue-Green → 2 environments: Blue (old), Green (new).</p>

<p>Blue runs old version.</p>

<p>Green runs new version.</p>

<p>Test Green fully.</p>

<p>Switch load balancer to Green.</p>

<p>Rollback to Blue if problem.</p>

<p>Canary → release to small users.</p>

<p>Monitor user feedback.</p>

<p>Increase traffic step by step.</p>

<p>If stable → send 100%.</p>

<p>Both reduce downtime.</p>

<h4>Q6. What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?</h4>

<p>Both combine code changes.</p>

<p>git merge keeps history as is.</p>

<p>Creates a new merge commit.</p>

<p>History becomes a little complex.</p>

<p>git rebase rewrites history.</p>

<p>Moves commits on top of latest branch.</p>

<p>History looks clean and linear.</p>

<p>Merge = good for big teams.</p>

<p>Rebase = good for small changes.</p>

<p>Merge safe for history.</p>

<p>Rebase risky if already pushed.</p>

<p>Both useful, depends on workflow.</p>

<h4>How do you resolve merge conflicts in Git?</h4>

<p>First pull latest changes.</p>

<p>Git shows conflict files.</p>

<h4>Q8. What branching strategy did you use (GitFlow, Feature Branching, etc.)?</h4>

<p>Used GitFlow mostly.</p>

<p>Main branch = master/main.</p>

<p>Development branch = develop.</p>

<p>Feature branches for new code.</p>

<p>Hotfix branches for urgent fixes.</p>

<p>Release branches for final testing.</p>

<p>After testing → merge into master.</p>

<p>Feature branch merged after code review.</p>

<p>GitFlow helps multiple teams.</p>

<p>You manage OS, patches, scaling.</p>

<p>Runs 24/7 or on demand.</p>

<p>Lambda = serverless function.</p>

<p>Runs code without server management.</p>

<p>Pay only for execution time.</p>

<p>Good for small, event-driven tasks.</p>

<p>ECS = container service.</p>

Run Docker containers at scale.

<p>You define cluster, tasks, services.</p>

<p>Good for microservices.</p>

<p>Choice depends on use case.</p>

<p>Security Group = instance-level firewall.</p>

<p>Works at EC2 instance level.</p>

<p>NACL = subnet-level firewall.</p>

<p>Works at VPC subnet level.</p>

<p>Security Groups are stateful.</p>

<p>NACLs are stateless.</p>

<p>Security Groups allow rules only.</p>

<p>NACLs allow and deny rules.</p>

<p>Security Group checks only inbound/outbound.</p>         

<p>NACL checks both ways every time.</p>

<p>Both used together for network security.</p>

<h4>Q17. How do you monitor AWS resources (CloudWatch, Grafana, Datadog)?</h4>

<p>Use CloudWatch for logs and metrics.</p>

<p>Set custom alarms in CloudWatch.</p>

<p>Collect CPU, memory, disk metrics.</p>

<p>Terraform better for cloud infra.</p>

<p>Ansible better for app config.</p>

<p>Both can be used together.</p>

<p>Example: Terraform creates EC2 → Ansible configures it.</p>

<h4>Q19. What is the difference between Terraform modules and resources?</h4>

<p>Resource = single AWS item (EC2, S3).</p>

<p>Each resource defines one infra element.</p>

<p>Module = group of resources.</p>

<p>Module is reusable and organized.</p>

<p>Example: VPC module includes VPC, subnets, route tables.</p>

<p>Resources = building blocks.</p>

<p>Modules = packages of blocks.</p>

<p>Modules help reduce code repetition.</p>

<p>Modules improve standardization.</p>

<p>Resources used directly in .tf file.</p>

<p>Modules called with module block.</p>

<p>Use modules for scalability.</p>

<h4>Q20. How do you manage Terraform state files?</h4>

<p>Use terraform refresh to sync.</p>

<p>Use terraform import for existing resources.</p>

<p>Rotate access permissions.</p>

<h4>Q21. Can you explain idempotency in Ansible?</h4>

<p>Idempotency = running playbook multiple times gives same result.</p>

<p>If resource already configured, no change.</p>

<p>If resource missing, Ansible creates it.</p>

<p>If config wrong, Ansible fixes it.</p>

<p>Ensures consistent environment.</p>

<p>Prevents duplicate changes.</p>

<p>Safe to rerun playbooks.</p>

<p>Saves time and reduces errors.</p>

<p>Example: install Apache → if already installed, no action.</p>

<p>Example: create user → if user exists, no change.</p>

<p>This makes Ansible reliable.</p>

<p>All tasks follow desired state.</p>

<h4>Q22. How do you manage secrets in Ansible?  </h4>

<p>Use Ansible Vault.</p>

<p>Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, keys).</p>

<p>Store in vault.yml file.</p>

<p>Run ansible-vault encrypt command.</p>

<p>Decrypt with ansible-vault decrypt.</p>

<p>Use ansible-vault view to see values.</p>

<p>Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager.</p>

<p>Keep separate vault files per environment.</p>

<h4>Q23. What is the difference between Docker image and container?</h4>

<p>Image = blueprint/template.</p>

<p>Container = running instance of image.</p>

<p>Image = static, read-only.</p>

<p>Container = dynamic, can run processes.</p>

<p>One image can create many containers.</p>

<p>Images stored in registry (Docker Hub).</p>

<p>Containers run on Docker engine.</p>

<p>Image includes code + dependencies.</p>

<p>Container uses OS resources.</p>

<p>Image built once, used many times.</p>

<p>Containers are temporary.</p>

<p>Images are permanent until deleted.</p>

<h4>Q24. How do you optimize a Dockerfile?</h4>

<p>Use small base image (Alpine).</p>

<p>Minimize number of layers.</p>

<p>Combine commands in one RUN.</p>

<p>Remove unnecessary packages.</p>

<p>Use .dockerignore to skip files.</p>

<p>Copy only needed files.</p>

<p>Use multi-stage builds.</p>

<p>Cache dependencies properly.</p>

<p>Avoid running as root.</p>

<p>Clean up temporary files.</p>

<p>Use healthcheck instruction.</p>

<p>Keep image size small.</p>

<h4>Q25. Explain Kubernetes components (Pod, Deployment, ReplicaSet, Service).</h4>

<p>Pod = smallest unit, runs container(s).</p>

<p>Pod can have 1 or more containers.</p>

<p>ReplicaSet = ensures multiple pods.</p>

<p>Provides scaling and high availability.</p>

<p>Deployment = manages ReplicaSets.</p>

<p>Handles rolling updates.</p>

<p>Service = exposes pods.</p>

<p>Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.</p>

<p>ClusterIP = internal access.</p>

<p>NodePort = external fixed port.</p>

<p>LoadBalancer = cloud-based access.</p>

<p>Together they run apps reliably.</p>

<h4>Q26. How do you perform rolling updates in Kubernetes?</h4>

<p>Rolling update = update pods step by step.</p>

<p>Use kubectl set image.</p>

<p>Or update Deployment YAML.</p>

<p>Kubernetes creates new pods.</p>

<p>Slowly replaces old pods.</p>

<p>No downtime during update.</p>

<p>Can set maxUnavailable and maxSurge.</p>

<p>Monitor rollout with kubectl rollout status.</p>

<p>Check logs for errors.</p>

<p>If failure → rollback with kubectl rollout undo.</p>

<p>Ensures smooth transition.</p>

<p>Safer than replacing all at once.</p>

<h4>Q27. What is the difference between ConfigMap and Secret in Kubernetes?</h4>

<p>Both store configuration data.</p>

<p>ConfigMap = non-sensitive data.</p>

<p>Example: URLs, app configs.</p>

<p>Stored in plain text.</p>

<p>Secret = sensitive data.</p>

<p>Example: passwords, API keys.</p>

<p>Stored in base64 encoded format.</p>

<p>Accessed by pods as env variables.</p>

<p>ConfigMap used for general settings.</p>

<p>Secret used for security.</p>

<h4> Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</h4>

<p>Amazon EC2 is a virtual server service that allows you to run applications in the cloud. You can choose different operating systems like Linux or Windows and select the size of your server depending on your needs. EC2 gives flexibility to start, stop, or resize instances at any time, and you only pay for what you use. Storage can be attached using EBS, and networking is secured with security groups. It supports Auto Scaling and Load Balancing to handle traffic changes. Custom machine images (AMIs) can be created for faster deployments. EC2 is widely used for hosting applications, websites, and backend services.</p>

<h4>Simple Storage Service (S3)</h4> 

<p>Amazon S3 is an object storage service that allows you to store unlimited amounts of data in buckets. It is highly durable with eleven nines (99.999999999%) of data protection, making it reliable for critical files. S3 supports versioning, so you can keep older versions of files, and lifecycle rules to automatically move or delete data. Files stored in S3 can be accessed via URLs and can also be encrypted for security. It is commonly used for storing backups, logs, images, and videos, and it can even host static websites. S3 integrates well with CloudFront for global content delivery.</p>

<h4>3. Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h4>

<p>AWS IAM helps you manage who can access AWS services and resources. With IAM, you can create users, groups, and roles, and then attach policies to give them specific permissions. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can be added for better security. Instead of using the root account, it is always recommended to create IAM users with least privilege access. IAM is free and works with all AWS services. It also supports federated access, meaning you can integrate external login systems like Active Directory or Google. IAM plays a key role in securing your AWS environment.</p>

<h4>4. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)</h4>

  <p>Elastic Load Balancer automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. This improves both availability and fault tolerance. AWS offers three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer for Layer 7 traffic (HTTP/HTTPS), Network Load Balancer for high-performance Layer 4 traffic (TCP/UDP), and Classic Load Balancer, which is the older version. ELB performs health checks to ensure traffic only goes to healthy servers. It supports SSL/TLS for secure connections, sticky sessions for user consistency, and integrates with Auto Scaling to handle traffic spikes.</p>

<h4> 5. Elastic Beanstalk</h4>

<p>Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure. Developers just upload their code, and Beanstalk automatically handles EC2, load balancers, Auto Scaling, and RDS if required. It supports multiple programming languages such as Java, Python, PHP, and Node.js. Beanstalk provides monitoring via CloudWatch and makes deployments easier with blue/green strategies. It is widely used for quick application hosting where developers want to focus only on code, not on servers.</p>

<h4> 6. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)</h4>

<p>Auto Scaling Groups ensure that the right number of EC2 instances are running at any time. They automatically add instances when demand increases and remove them when demand decreases, saving costs. ASGs improve availability by replacing unhealthy instances and maintaining minimum numbers of servers. You can define scaling policies based on CPU usage, memory, or custom CloudWatch metrics. They work closely with load balancers to distribute traffic and provide a reliable, cost-efficient infrastructure setup.</p>

<h4> 7. Elastic Block Storage (EBS)</h4>

<p>Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances. It acts like a hard drive in the cloud and stores data persistently, even if the EC2 instance is stopped. Different volume types are available such as SSDs for performance and HDDs for cost-efficient storage. You can resize volumes, take snapshots for backup, and enable encryption for data security. EBS is commonly used for operating systems, databases, and any workload that requires fast, persistent storage.</p>

<h4> 8. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h4>

<p>Amazon VPC allows you to create a private network within AWS. You can define subnets as public or private, attach Internet Gateways for public access, and use NAT Gateways for controlled internet access from private subnets. Security is managed using Security Groups and Network ACLs. Route tables define how traffic flows inside the VPC. You can also connect your VPC to on-premises networks using VPN or Direct Connect. Each AWS account comes with a default VPC, but you can create custom VPCs for better security and control.</p>

<h4> 9. Amazon Machine Images (AMI)</h4>

<p>An Amazon Machine Image is a template used to create EC2 instances. An AMI contains the operating system, application server, and custom software if needed. AWS provides public AMIs, but you can also create your own for standardizing deployments. AMIs can be copied between regions and shared with other accounts. The main benefit of AMIs is faster and consistent server launches. They are essential when deploying multiple servers with the same configuration.</p>

<h4> 10. Simple Notification Service (SNS)</h4>

<p>Amazon SNS is a messaging service that uses a publish/subscribe model. Applications or users can publish messages to a topic, and subscribers such as email, SMS, SQS, or Lambda functions receive those messages. SNS is scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. It is widely used for sending alerts, notifications, and automated messages. For example, CloudWatch alarms can use SNS to notify admins about system issues. SNS ensures fast and reliable message delivery across applications.</p>

<h4> 11. AWS CodePipeline</h4>

<p>AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service. It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. A pipeline consists of stages such as source, build, test, and deploy. CodePipeline integrates with AWS services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and third-party tools like GitHub and Jenkins. It also supports manual approvals for production releases. CodePipeline helps organizations deliver software quickly and reliably, following DevOps practices.</p>

<h4> 12. Relational Database Service (RDS)</h4>

<p>Amazon RDS is a managed database service that supports popular engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB. AWS handles backups, patching, and updates, reducing admin work. RDS provides high availability with Multi-AZ deployments and scaling with read replicas. Databases can be encrypted, monitored with CloudWatch, and integrated with IAM for security. It is commonly used for web and enterprise applications needing relational databases without manual maintenance.</p>

<h4> 13. CloudWatch</h4>
