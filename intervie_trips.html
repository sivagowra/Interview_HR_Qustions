    <h1>DevOps Engineer Interview – Ready Responses</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Self Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Sivannarayana Gowra. I have around one year of hands-on experience
            in DevOps and AWS. I have worked with AWS services like EC2, S3, IAM, VPC,
            RDS, and Load Balancers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have experience in creating CI/CD pipelines using Git and Jenkins to automate
            build and deployment processes. I have containerized applications using Docker
            and deployed them on Kubernetes using Deployments and NodePort services.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have good Linux knowledge and handle monitoring using AWS CloudWatch.
            Currently, I am improving my skills in Kubernetes, AWS, and automation, and I am
            looking for a DevOps role where I can contribute to production systems and grow
            technically.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            I work mainly with AWS, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, and CloudWatch.
            For AWS, I use EC2 for compute, S3 for storage, IAM for access control, VPC for
            networking, and RDS for databases.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>CI/CD Pipeline Explanation</h2>
        <p>
            My CI/CD pipeline starts with code pushed to GitHub. Jenkins pulls the code,
            builds the Docker image, runs basic checks, and pushes the image to Docker Hub.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then the application is deployed on EC2 or Kubernetes using Deployment and
            Service objects. This reduces manual deployment errors and improves release speed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Kubernetes Deployment</h2>
        <p>
            First, I create a Docker image and push it to a container registry. Then I create
            a Kubernetes Deployment YAML to manage pods and replicas.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, I expose the application using a NodePort service so it can be
            accessed externally. I monitor the pods using kubectl and CloudWatch.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Production Issue Handling</h2>
        <p>
            First, I check monitoring alerts from CloudWatch. Then I analyze logs, check CPU
            and memory usage, and identify the root cause.
        </p>
        <p>
            I apply the fix, redeploy if needed, and monitor the system to ensure stability.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why Should We Hire You?</h2>
        <p>
            I have hands-on DevOps experience, strong AWS fundamentals, and practical
            knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learn quickly, follow best practices, and I am comfortable working with
            production systems. I am motivated to grow and contribute effectively to the team.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Experience</h2>
        <p>
            I have deployed containerized web applications using Docker and Kubernetes,
            configured CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, and managed AWS infrastructure for
            practice and learning environments.
