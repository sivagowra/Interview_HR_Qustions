         <h2>Instances</h2>
         <p>
            An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server that provides resizable computing capacity in the cloud. 
            It allows users to run applications just like on a physical machine, but with the flexibility to scale up or down as needed. 
            Each instance can be configured with specific operating systems, storage, and networking options. 
            Instances can be launched, stopped, or terminated based on workload requirements, giving users full control over their compute resources.
            They are billed according to the amount of time they run and the pricing model chosen.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Instance Types</h2>
         <p>
            Instance types define the combination of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity available to EC2 instances. 
            AWS offers many families of instance types optimized for different tasks such as general purpose, compute intensive, memory intensive, or storage optimized workloads. 
            By selecting the right instance type, users can ensure their applications perform efficiently and cost-effectively. 
            Each instance type provides a balance of resources suited for specific performance needs.
            This flexibility allows organizations to match computing power to their application’s requirements.

      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Launch Templates</h2>
         <p>
            Launch Templates in AWS are blueprints that store configuration settings used to create EC2 instances consistently.
            They contain details such as the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instance type, key pair, security groups, and network settings.
            By using templates, teams can standardize instance launches and reduce manual errors. 
            They also support versioning, allowing users to modify configurations without losing older versions. 
            This feature simplifies automation and makes large-scale instance deployment faster and more reliable.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Spot Requests</h2>
         <p>
            Spot Requests allow users to purchase unused EC2 capacity at discounted prices compared to On-Demand rates. 
            When a user submits a Spot Request, AWS fulfills it if spare capacity is available and terminates it when demand increases. 
            This model is ideal for fault-tolerant or flexible workloads such as data analysis or testing. 
            It provides substantial cost savings, often up to 90%, though availability may vary.
            Users can specify maximum bid prices or let AWS manage bids automatically through Spot Fleets.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Savings Plans</h2>
         <p>
            Savings Plans are flexible pricing models that help users save money on AWS compute usage
            by committing to a consistent amount of usage (in $/hour) over one or three years. 
            Unlike Reserved Instances, Savings Plans automatically apply discounts across EC2, Fargate, and Lambda. 
            They offer two types—Compute Savings Plans for the most flexibility, and EC2 Instance Savings Plans for specific instance families. 
            This model allows users to reduce costs while maintaining flexibility to change regions, instance sizes, or operating systems.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Reserved Instances</h2>
         <p>
            Reserved Instances (RIs) provide significant discounts compared to On-Demand pricing in exchange for 
            committing to use specific instance types in a region for a one- or three-year term.
            They are best suited for steady-state workloads with predictable usage.
            RIs can be either Standard (offering the highest savings) or Convertible (allowing instance type changes).
            This model helps organizations reduce long-term compute costs. 
            While less flexible than Savings Plans, RIs offer reliable capacity and predictable billing.

      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Dedicated Hosts</h2>
         <p>
            A Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated to a single AWS customer. 
            It allows users to use their existing software licenses that are bound to physical hardware, helping meet compliance or regulatory requirements. 
            Dedicated Hosts provide visibility into the physical sockets and cores, giving users greater control over placement. 
            They eliminate “noisy neighbor” issues by isolating workloads on private hardware. 
            This option is ideal for organizations requiring strict security or licensing control over their cloud infrastructure.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Capacity Reservations</h2>
         <p>
            Capacity Reservations guarantee EC2 instance capacity in a specific Availability Zone for as long as needed. 
            They ensure that users can launch instances at any time without worrying about capacity shortages.
            This is particularly useful for mission-critical or time-sensitive applications. 
            Users pay On-Demand rates whether or not the reserved capacity is used. 
            Capacity Reservations can also be combined with Savings Plans or RIs to optimize costs while ensuring guaranteed compute availability.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Capacity Manager</h2>
         <p>
            Capacity Manager is an AWS feature that helps users plan and manage EC2 capacity efficiently.
            It provides insights into current and future capacity needs, helping organizations avoid shortages during scaling or high-demand events. 
            Through automation and monitoring, Capacity Manager ensures optimal utilization of resources across Availability Zones.
            It integrates with other AWS services to balance performance and cost.
            This feature helps maintain high availability and reliability for applications that depend on consistent compute power.

      <h1>images</h1>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</h2>
         <p>
            An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template that contains the information required to launch an EC2 instance. 
            It includes the operating system, application server, and any software or settings needed for deployment. 
            When you start an instance, you choose an AMI as the base image, ensuring that every new instance is identical in setup.
            AMIs simplify scaling by allowing you to create multiple instances with the same configuration. 
            Users can create custom AMIs or use public ones provided by AWS or the community.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>AMI Catalog</h2>
         <p>
            The AMI Catalog is a centralized collection of available Amazon Machine Images that users can browse and select from when launching instances. 
            It includes AMIs provided by AWS, third-party vendors, and community contributors. 
            The catalog makes it easy to search for images based on criteria such as operating system, software stack, region, or architecture. 
            Users can also manage private AMIs they’ve created within their own accounts. 
            By using the AMI Catalog, organizations can quickly find secure, optimized, and up-to-date images for their workloads.

      <h1>Elastic Block Store</h1>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Volumes</h2>
         <p>
            In Amazon EC2, a Volume refers to an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, which provides persistent storage for your instances. 
            It acts like a virtual hard drive that can be attached to one or more EC2 instances.
            Volumes remain available even after an instance is stopped, allowing data to persist independently. 
            They can be resized, backed up, and encrypted for security and flexibility. 
            Different volume types offer various performance levels to suit workloads such as databases, analytics, or general computing.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Snapshots</h2>
         <p>
            A Snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an Amazon EBS volume. 
            It captures the data stored on the volume and saves it to Amazon S3 for durability and long-term storage. 
            Snapshots make it easy to restore volumes or create new ones with the same data configuration. 
            They are incremental, meaning only changed data is saved after the first snapshot, which reduces storage costs. 
            Snapshots are commonly used for data backup, disaster recovery, and migrating volumes across regions.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Lifecycle Manager</h2>
         <p>
            The Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) automates the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots and AMIs. 
            It helps manage backup policies to ensure data protection without manual intervention. 
            Users can define lifecycle policies specifying when to create backups and how long to retain them. 
            This automation reduces storage costs and ensures compliance with organizational data retention requirements. 
            DLM improves reliability by regularly creating and cleaning up backups based on user-defined schedules.
         </p>

      <h1>Network & Security</h1>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Network and Security</h2>
         <p>
            The Network & Security section in Amazon EC2 manages how instances communicate securely within the AWS cloud and with the internet.
            It includes tools and resources like VPCs, subnets, route tables, and firewalls to control network flow. Through these features, 
            users can design isolated networks, set access rules, and manage IP addressing. 
            Security mechanisms like encryption and identity controls protect data in transit and at rest. 
            Together, these features provide a secure and flexible foundation for running applications in AWS.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Security Groups</h2>
         <p>
            A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
            It defines which protocols, ports, and IP ranges are allowed to connect to the instance.
            Security Groups are stateful, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed once a request is permitted. 
            You can associate multiple security groups with an instance for fine-grained control. 
            This ensures only trusted and necessary traffic reaches your resources, enhancing network security.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Elastic IPs</h2>
         <p>
            An Elastic IP address (EIP) is a static, public IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.
            Unlike regular IPs that change when an instance is stopped, an Elastic IP remains constant. 
            It allows you to quickly remap the address to another instance in case of failure, ensuring high availability.
            EIPs are particularly useful for hosting applications that require a fixed public endpoint.
            AWS charges for unused EIPs to encourage efficient IP usage.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Placement Groups</h2>
         <p>
            Placement Groups determine how EC2 instances are physically arranged within AWS infrastructure to optimize performance or availability.
            There are three types—Cluster, Spread, and Partition. 
            Cluster groups place instances close together for low-latency, high-throughput networking. 
            Spread groups distribute instances across hardware to reduce correlated failures. 
            Partition groups organize instances into partitions for large-scale distributed workloads.
            Choosing the right placement strategy ensures better performance, reliability, and fault tolerance.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Key Pair</h2>
         <p>
            A Key Pair in EC2 is used to securely connect to instances using SSH or RDP without needing a password.
            It consists of a public key stored by AWS and a private key kept by the user. 
            When launching an instance, AWS installs the public key, allowing authentication using the private key.
            Losing the private key can result in losing access to the instance, so it must be stored carefully. 
            Key Pairs ensure secure, encrypted communication between users and their instances.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Network Interfaces</h2>
         <p>
            A Network Interface, also known as an Elastic Network Interface (ENI), represents a virtual network card attached to an EC2 instance.
            It includes attributes such as a primary private IP address, MAC address, and one or more security groups. 
            ENIs enable flexible network configurations, such as managing multiple IPs or separating traffic for monitoring. 
            They can be attached, detached, or moved between instances for fault tolerance. 
            Network Interfaces provide greater control over networking and redundancy in complex architectures.
         </p>
      </article>
      <article class="content no-break">
         <h2>Auto Scaling Groups</h2>
         <p>
            An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) in Amazon EC2 automatically manages the number of instances running in your application to maintain performance and cost efficiency. 
            It ensures that the right number of EC2 instances are available to handle traffic or workload changes. When demand increases, 
            the group launches new instances; when demand decreases, it terminates unnecessary ones. 
            ASGs use scaling policies and CloudWatch alarms to decide when to adjust capacity. 
            This automation improves reliability, reduces manual intervention, and optimizes costs by matching capacity to actual demand.

      <br>
<h1>On-Demand Instances</h1>
      <div>
  On-Demand Instances allow you to run servers whenever you need without any long-term commitment. 
  You pay only for the compute time you actually use, which makes it very flexible. 
  This is perfect for short workloads, testing, or new applications where usage is unpredictable. 
  You can start, stop, or terminate instances anytime based on your requirement. 
  Although easy and flexible, On-Demand is the most expensive option compared to other pricing models.
</div>
<br>
<h1>Savings Plans</h1>
<div>
  Savings Plans provide lower prices when you commit to a certain amount of compute usage for one or three years. 
  Instead of committing to a specific instance type, you commit to a fixed hourly spend like 5 USD/hour. 
  This plan automatically applies discounts across EC2, Lambda, and Fargate. 
  It offers more flexibility because you can change instance types, sizes, or regions. 
  Savings Plans are ideal for stable workloads where usage is predictable and long-term.
</div>
<br>
<h1>Reserved Instances</h1>
<div>
  Reserved Instances offer significant discounts when you commit to using a specific instance type in a specific region for one or three years. 
  They work best when your workload is steady and always running. 
  You get cheaper pricing compared to On-Demand, but you need to plan usage in advance. 
  Reserved Instances are commonly used for production servers that run 24/7. 
  They reduce cost but offer less flexibility than Savings Plans.
</div>
<br>
<h1>Spot Instances</h1>
<div>
  Spot Instances let you use AWS’s unused EC2 capacity at extremely low prices, sometimes up to 90% cheaper. 
  They are ideal for flexible and fault-tolerant applications because AWS may stop them when capacity is needed. 
  Spot is best for workloads like big data processing, machine learning training, and background jobs. 
  You cannot rely on Spot for critical applications because it may stop anytime. 
  This option is great when you need maximum savings and can handle interruptions.
</div>
<br>
<h1>Dedicated Hosts</h1>
<div>
  Dedicated Hosts give you a full physical server dedicated only to your account. 
  You get full control over hardware, CPU, memory, and placement of instances. 
  This is useful when you have strict licensing rules or compliance requirements. 
  Since the entire server is yours, no other AWS customer shares it. 
  Dedicated Hosts offer the highest isolation, but they are also the most expensive option.
</div>
<br>
<h1>Dedicated Instances </h1>
<div>
  Dedicated Instances run on hardware that is dedicated only to your AWS account but shared within your own instances. 
  They provide physical isolation from other customers but are more flexible than Dedicated Hosts. 
  They are useful when you need isolation for compliance but do not require full server control. 
  You do not choose the exact hardware, but AWS ensures you do not share it with others. 
  Dedicated Instances cost more than regular On-Demand but less than Dedicated Hosts.
</div>
<br>
<h1>Capacity Reservations</h1>
<div>
  Capacity Reservations allow you to reserve EC2 capacity in a specific Availability Zone without any long-term commitment. 
  They guarantee that the instance type you want will always be available, even during high demand. 
  You can create or cancel the reservation anytime, which gives flexibility. 
  This is ideal for critical workloads that must never fail due to capacity shortages. 
  You pay On-Demand pricing but get 100% availability assurance.
</div>
