<div class="service">
<h2>Amazon EC2</h2>
<p class="intro">EC2 is the main service used to run servers in AWS.</p>
<p>
Amazon EC2 allows users to create virtual computers in the cloud. These virtual machines are called instances and can run Linux or Windows operating systems. EC2 removes the need to buy physical servers. Users can increase or decrease server size at any time. EC2 supports different instance types based on performance needs. It works closely with storage and networking services. Security is controlled using key pairs and firewall rules. EC2 is widely used to host applications and websites.
</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
<h2>Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)</h2>
<p class="intro">ELB helps manage traffic when many users access an application.</p>
<p>
Elastic Load Balancer spreads incoming traffic across multiple servers. This prevents a single server from becoming overloaded. ELB improves application availability and reliability. It automatically sends traffic only to healthy servers. ELB supports HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP traffic. It works well with Auto Scaling to handle traffic changes. SSL security can be configured easily. ELB is important for high-traffic applications.
</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
<h2>Auto Scaling</h2>
<p class="intro">Auto Scaling keeps applications stable during traffic changes.</p>
<p>
Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances. It helps applications handle high traffic without manual work. When traffic increases, new instances are added automatically. When traffic reduces, extra instances are removed to save cost. Auto Scaling uses rules based on CPU or memory usage. It improves fault tolerance by replacing unhealthy instances. It works with ELB for better performance. This service reduces downtime and cost.
</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
<h2>Elastic Block Store (EBS)</h2>
<p class="intro">EBS provides storage for EC2 instances.</p>
<p>
Amazon EBS is a block storage service used with EC2. It works like a hard disk for virtual servers. Data stored in EBS is persistent even if the instance stops. Users can create backups using snapshots. EBS supports different volume types for speed and cost. It is reliable and secure. EBS is commonly used for databases. It ensures fast read and write operations.
</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
<h2>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</h2>

</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
<h2>IAM</h2>
<p class="intro">IAM controls who can access AWS resources.</p>
<p>
IAM is used to manage users and permissions in AWS. It allows creating users, groups, and roles. Permissions are given using policies. IAM follows least privilege security principle. Multi-factor authentication increases security. Roles are used by services to access resources. IAM works across all AWS services. It is critical for cloud security.
</p>
</div>

<div class="service">
<h2>Amazon Route 53</h2>
<p class="intro">Route 53 connects domain names to applications.</p>
<p>
Route 53 is a DNS service that converts domain names to IP addresses. It provides fast and reliable routing. Health checks help route traffic to healthy servers. It supports different routing policies. Route 53 integrates with ELB and CloudFront. Domain registration is also supported. It improves global application performance. Route 53 ensures high availability.
</p>
